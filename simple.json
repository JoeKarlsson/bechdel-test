					"Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, 's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by ), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. Starring and as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.",

								"With her expressive blue eyes, soft, Southern-tinged voice and an acting range that can carry her from hysterically funny to terrifying in seconds, Patricia Arquette is one of the most underrated and talented actresses of her generation. Though she has been working for years, she's always stayed just under the radar of true stardom, despite a 1995 marriage to Nicolas Cage. Patricia was born in Chicago, though the family soon moved to a commune near Arlington, Virginia. Her parents, Lewis Arquette, an actor, and Brenda Denaut (née Nowak), an acting teacher and therapist, had 4 other children: Rosanna Arquette, Richmond Arquette, Alexis Arquette, and David Arquette, all actors. Her paternal grandfather, Cliff Arquette, was also an entertainer. Patricia's mother was from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Poland and Russia), while Patricia's father had French-Canadian, Swiss-German, and English ancestry. At 15, Patricia ran away from home to live with her sister Rosanna and, after initial insecurity, got her start in Pretty Smart (1987). A year later, she gained attention for her starring role in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), considered by many to be the best film of the Nightmare series. In 1989, Patricia's son, Enzo (father is Paul Rossi), was born. Soon after, her career took off, and she has since appeared in such critically acclaimed movies as True Romance (1993), Beyond Rangoon (1995), Ethan Frome (1993), Lost Highway (1997) and Flirting with Disaster (1996). She won a CableACE award in 1991 for her portrayal of a deaf epileptic in Wildflower (1991). In 1997, after her mother died of breast cancer, Patricia took the lead in the fight against the disease. She has run in the annual Race for the Cure and in 1999 was the Lee National Denim Day spokesperson.",

							"birthName": "Margaret Elizabeth Webb",
							"bio":
								"Libby Villari was born a Tarhill and a hick in Winston-Salem, N.C. and credits the beauty and magic of rural North Carolina for her love of, and reverence for Nature. Her roots still inform who she is today. At age 11 she moved to Sunland-Tujunga on the outskirts of Los Angeles. She embraced Southern California as her new home, graduated from Verdugo Hills High School, married, gave birth to her son, and embraced all things alternative and natural, including political activism. She became part of the \"back to the land\" movement of the 60's when she and her first husband moved to Fort Worth, Texas, settling down in the boonies outside the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolis. The idea was to own & tend land and nurture a communal way of life. Some of that worked out, and there are some great stories from that time in her life. Before returning to school at age 27, a show biz career had never entered her mind. A college scholarship in Speech lead to her B.A. in Theater from North Texas University, & upon graduation at age 30 she started her acting career. Acclaimed stage performances landed her an agent, she spent time honing her craft with the legendary Hip Pocket Theater and traveled with them to the Edinburgh, Scotland Theater Festival, she did several theater tours across the South, and in the early 90's her screen career began to take off. She's managed to cobble together a stellar career while living on a secluded North Texas Lake, far away from the limelight, with her husband of 30 years, Matt Barnes. She's worked with many acclaimed directors including Richard Linklater, Peter Berg, Robert Altman, Alan Parker, Clint Eastwood, Lasse Halstrom, Robert Rodriguez, Kimberly Pierce and James Marsh. People in the business describe Libby as earthy, authentic, sassy, irreverent, funny, and passionate about the civil liberties of ALL people and protecting the environment. She splits her time between her Texas lake home, Los Angeles, and The Smokie Mountains in North Carolina where some of her family still resides. She's recently returned to the stage to play Ann Richards in Holland Taylor's acclaimed ANN and audiences are raving about her portrayal. Libby IS Ann Richards & was born to play her.",

							"bio":
								"Ethan Green Hawke was born on November 6, 1970 in Austin, Texas, to Leslie Carole (Green), a charity worker, and James Steven Hawke, an insurance actuary. His parents were students at the University of Texas at the time but divorced when Ethan was 5 years old. His mother raised him alone for the next five years, moving around the country, until she remarried in 1981 and the family settled in Princeton Junction, New Jersey. He attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and then transferred to the Hun School of Princeton and it was while he was there that he began taking acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus. His early ambition had been to be a writer, but as a result of the acting lessons and appearances in student productions he persuaded his mother to allow him to attend an audition for a role in a sci-fi adolescent adventure, Explorers (1985). He got the role (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for several years. He was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society (1989) and he did not complete his degree. He then appeared in numerous films before taking a role in the Generation X drama Reality Bites (1994) for which he received critical praise. He starred in the romantic drama Before Sunrise (1995), and its later sequels Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013). His subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony Award nomination for his role in \"The Coast of Utopia\" at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of serious and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Training Day (2001). His role as the father in the coming-of-age drama Boyhood (2014) earned him multiple award nominations, including the Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actor. Meanwhile, he also wrote two novels: \"The Hottest State\" (1996) and \"Ash Wednesday\" (2002).",
