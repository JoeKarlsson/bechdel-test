    <p>The Bechdel Test, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule is a simple test which names the following three criteria:</br></br>

    1) It includes at least two women</br>
    2) who have at least one conversation</br>
    3) about something other than a man or men.</br></br>

    The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule. For a nice video introduction to the subject please check out The Bechdel Test for Women in Movies on feministfrequency.com.</p>
