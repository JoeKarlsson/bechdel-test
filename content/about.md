The <strong>Bechdel Test</strong>, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule is a simple test which names the following three criteria: </br></br>

(1) it has to have at least two women in it, who </br>
(2) who talk to each other, about </br>
(3) something besides a man.</br></br>

The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule. For a nice video introduction to the subject please check out The Bechdel Test for Women in Movies on feministfrequency.com.
