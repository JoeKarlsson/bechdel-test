          The Bechdel Test, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule
          is a simple test which names the following three criteria:
        </p>
        <p>1) It includes at least two women</p>
        <p>2) who have at least one conversation</p>
        <p>3) about something other than a man or men.</p>
        <p>
          The test was popularized by Alison Bechdels comic Dykes to Watch Out For,
          in a 1985 strip called The Rule. For a nice video introduction to the
          subject please check out The Bechdel Test for Women in Movies on
