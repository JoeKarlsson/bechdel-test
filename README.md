#Bechdel Test Movie Script Parser

##The Bechdel Test, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule is a simple test which names the following three criteria:

1. It includes at least two women
2. who have at least one conversation
3. about something other than a man or men.

The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule. For a nice video introduction to the subject please check out The Bechdel Test for Women in Movies on feministfrequency.com.

This program accepts a movie script and analzes whether or not it passes the Beschel Test, as well as analyzing several other feminist components to a film. It can answer questions like "How many females are in this film," "By what factor does this pass the Bechel Test?"

##Usage
1. Intall node.js https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Git Clone/Fork project
3. cd beschel-test
4. run 'npm Install'

This will install the node and npm executables onto your system and have you ready to use Node.

5. run 'npm start' or 'DEBUG=myapp:* npm start' if you want to test the app
6. Open your browser window to 'http://localhost:3000/'
7. Input a movie script .txt movie script and see if the film passes the Beschel Test

##Updating Code from GitHub
1. Navigate to the beschel-test directory in terminal ('cd Desktop/beschel-test')
2. If you don't care about any local changes and just want a copy from the repo:

- git reset --hard HEAD
- git clean -f
- git pull

Again, this will nuke any changes you've made locally so use carefully.

##Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

##Notes about parsing movie scripts
When a character speaks, his or her name is capitalized and centered on the page. The characterâ€™s dialogue generally appears one line below. As we discuss below, there are variations within this general format that create parsing challenges.

##Todo
- Parse movie scripts (.txt or .html)
- Show data - Where and when they talk
- Score: How much of the movie contains dialogue that passes the test
- Breakdown:
    Male to male interactions
    male to female interactions
    female to female interactions
    Other
-Number of scenes with women v # w/ men
-Do directors tend to make movies that pass the Beschdal test?
