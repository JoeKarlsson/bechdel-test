#Bechdel Test Movie Script Parser

##The Bechdel Test, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule is a simple test which names the following three criteria:

1. It includes at least two women
2. who have at least one conversation
3. about something other than a man or men.

The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule. For a nice video introduction to the subject please check out The Bechdel Test for Women in Movies on feministfrequency.com.

This program accepts a movie script and analzes whether or not it passes the Beschel Test, as well as analyzing several other feminist components to a film. It can answer questions like "How many females are in this film," "By what factor does this pass the Bechel Test?"

## Requirements
This uses [jspm](http://jspm.io/) as the browser package manager and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for build automation during development so you should have these installed globally

##Usage
1. Intall [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. ```npm install -g jspm```
3. ```npm install -g gulp```
4. Git Clone/Fork project ```git clone git@github.com:JoeKarlsson1/beschel-test.git```
5. ```cd beschel-test```
6. ```npm install```
7. ```jspm install```
This will install the node and npm executables onto your system and have you ready to use Node.
5. ```gulp```
Starts web application
6. Open your browser window to 'http://localhost:3000/'

##Updating Code from GitHub
1. Navigate to the beschel-test directory in terminal ```cd Desktop/beschel-test```
2. If you don't care about any local changes and just want a copy from the repo:

- ```git fetch --all```
- ```git pull```

Your code should now be up to date! ;)

##Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: ```git checkout -b my-new-feature```
3. Commit your changes: ```git commit -am 'Add some feature'```
4. Push to the branch: ````git push origin my-new-feature````
5. Submit a pull request :D

##Notes about parsing movie scripts
When a character speaks, his or her name is capitalized and centered on the page. The characterâ€™s dialogue generally appears one line below. As we discuss below, there are variations within this general format that create parsing challenges.

##Todo
- Show data - Where and when they talk
- Score: How much of the movie contains dialogue that passes the test
- Breakdown:
    Male to male interactions
    male to female interactions
    female to female interactions
    Other
-Number of scenes with women v # w/ men
-Do directors tend to make movies that pass the Beschdal test?
