EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - DAY
MASON waits outside his elementary school, laying in the grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him.
MOM
Hey, love bug. You ready?
He is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the car.
MASON
Yeah. Hey, guess what, Mom?
MOM What?
MASON
I figured out where wasps come from.
MOM Oh, yeah? Where?
MASON
Well, I think it must be if you flick
a rock into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp.
MOM Dang...
Yep.
MASON
MOM That's cool.
INT. CAR - DAY Driving...
MOM
So how was your day at school?
Fine.
MASON
MOM
Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss
Butler this time. I kinda liked her.
MASON What did she say?
MOM
Have you read them?
MASON Sure haven't.
JILL
I tried... but it was so cheesy! So
how do you like San Marcos?
MASON
I like it alright. It's a lot smaller
than Houston, but it seems pretty cool. Have you always lived here?
88.
JILL
Yeah. If you want the big city around
here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin. Have you been there yet?
MASON
I went to San Antonio for a day,
but... I haven't been to Austin yet.
JILL
That's where all the high school
kids go, on weekends, for shows and stuff.
MASON That's what I've heard.
JILL
So are you going to Shauna's party
next weekend?
MASON
Um... I think I heard about it. I'm
not really sure, though.
JILL Well you should!
MASON Why's that?
JILL
Well -- LeeAnn has a big crush on
you and I know she was hoping you would go. You don't have a girlfriend, do you?
MASON Not currently.
JILL
Well then, you should come. I'll
tell Chase to make sure you're there.
Okay.
MASON
JILL
But don't tell LeeAnn I told you
that. She'd kill me.
MASON I won't.
89.
JILL
Well, I better get going. See you
later.
Bye.
