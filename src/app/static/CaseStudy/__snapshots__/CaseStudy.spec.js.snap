      The Bechdel Test, popularized by cartoonist Alison Bechdel, uses three simple requirements to test whether a film, or any work of fiction, features a scene with two women speaking to each other about something other than a man. The test is often used to highlight the sexism present in the film industry, as a surprising number of films tested do not pass, despite the test’s relatively simple requirements. While feminism as a concept has become much more socially accepted in recent years, the film industry is still largely dominated by men. Not only are the majority of speaking roles in films played by men, but important behind-the-scenes roles, such as directing and screenwriting, are still largely male-dominated as well. In order to get a feel for the current state of the film industry using recent data from popular and critically acclaimed films, we’ve chosen to analyze thirteen films that were nominated for Oscars in 2015 in the following highly-anticipated categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress.

      A quick glance at the Bechdel Test pass/fail data for the 87th Annual Academy Awards (originally aired on February 22, 2015) makes the gender imbalance immediately clear. Of all of the Oscar nominated films that we were able to test, only 38.46% passed the Bechdel Test. This percentage is somewhat generous, as only 28.57% of the Best Picture nominees passed the test. The category of Best Picture gives the best general overview of the year’s critically acclaimed films, as the Best Picture category is not limited by the gender of the lead actors (as are the categories of Best Actor and Best Actress). When the Academy has free reign to choose the eight films that they feel were the best overall films of the year, it’s incredibly revealing to see how those eight films stack up in terms of gender. While 28.57% of the Best Picture nominees passed the Bechdel Test, it’s also important to note that all eight of the nominees were focused on a male-dominated narrative, each of them featuring a male lead rather than a female lead.

      It’s interesting to note the lack of overlap between Best Picture nominees and films featuring a nominee for Best Actress. Only one of the films featuring a nominee for Best Actress was also nominated for Best Picture: The Theory of Everything. What this reveals is the lack of lead actresses being featured in Best Picture nominees, which points out the Academy’s preference for films with a male-dominated narrative. On the other hand, four of the films featuring a nominee for Best Actor were also nominated for Best Picture: The Theory of Everything, American Sniper, The Imitation Game, and Birdman. It’s easy for Best Picture nominees to also feature a nominee for Best Actor when all of the Best Picture nominees are led by men. This preference for male-lead narratives is also present in the Bechdel Test statistics for films featuring a Best Actor nominee versus a Best Actress nominee; while 50% of the films featuring a Best Actress nominee pass the test (neither of which were also nominated for Best Picture), only 20% of the films featuring a Best Actor nominee pass. The Academy’s preference for male-dominated films is obvious here. When nominating women for the category of Best Actress, they are forced to look outside the canon of Best Picture nominees, since very few of the Best Picture nominees feature a lead actress .

      This male bias holds up when films featuring Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress nominees are factored in. On their own, only 20% of films featuring a nominee for Best Supporting Actor pass the test, while 60% of films featuring a nominee for Best Supporting Actress pass -- the imbalance here is clear. The tendency of films with a male lead to fail the Bechdel Test suggests that when a film’s narrative is dominated by men, female characters are so heavily disregarded that they rarely feature in a scene together.

      This analysis of 2015 Oscar films says a great deal about the film industry as a whole. When the majority of the year’s most critically-acclaimed films do not pass the Bechdel Test, there is a clear issue with the opportunities for women in every area of the film industry. Not only are leading roles not nearly as available to women as they are to men, but very few women are writing and directing Oscar-nominated films. In order to create valuable roles for women, women need to be involved in the filmmaking process. We need women making films in order to tell important stories about women.

      There were a few challenges that we faced in this Oscar film analysis that should be addressed. The first involved the film Selma, which was nominated for Best Picture. The screenplay for this film was not openly available, and thus we were unable to include it in our testing. Another challenge involved the film Two Days, One Night, which featured Best Actress nominee Marion Cotillard. This is a French language film that was subtitled in English. Since the screenplay was only available in French language, it was not suited for our Bechdel Test tool, so we were unable to include it as well.
