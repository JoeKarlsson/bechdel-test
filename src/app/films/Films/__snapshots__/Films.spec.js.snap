      <p>
        The Bechdel.io was a collaborative project between a English Scholar and a Software Engineer. With the tool we’ve created, the process of determing whether a film passes the Beschdel Test is automated, which allows massive amounts of data to be generated with ease. Thus, data can be produced for large bodies of film, i.e. a certain director’s filmography, a certain actress’ body of work, or for the films released in a specific year.
