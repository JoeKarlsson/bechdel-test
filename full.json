Starring and as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.",

"height": "5' 2\" (1.57 m)",
"bio": "With her expressive blue eyes, soft, Southern-tinged voice and an acting range that can carry her from hysterically funny to terrifying in seconds, Patricia Arquette is one of the most underrated and talented actresses of her generation. Though she has been working for years, she's always stayed just under the radar of true stardom, despite a 1995 marriage to Nicolas Cage. Patricia was born in Chicago, though the family soon moved to a commune near Arlington, Virginia. Her parents, Lewis Arquette, an actor, and Brenda Denaut (née Nowak), an acting teacher and therapist, had 4 other children: Rosanna Arquette, Richmond Arquette, Alexis Arquette, and David Arquette, all actors. Her paternal grandfather, Cliff Arquette, was also an entertainer. Patricia's mother was from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Poland and Russia), while Patricia's father had French-Canadian, Swiss-German, and English ancestry. At 15, Patricia ran away from home to live with her sister Rosanna and, after initial insecurity, got her start in Pretty Smart (1987). A year later, she gained attention for her starring role in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), considered by many to be the best film of the Nightmare series. In 1989, Patricia's son, Enzo (father is Paul Rossi), was born. Soon after, her career took off, and she has since appeared in such critically acclaimed movies as True Romance (1993), Beyond Rangoon (1995), Ethan Frome (1993), Lost Highway (1997) and Flirting with Disaster (1996). She won a CableACE award in 1991 for her portrayal of a deaf epileptic in Wildflower (1991). In 1997, after her mother died of breast cancer, Patricia took the lead in the fight against the disease. She has run in the annual Race for the Cure and in 1999 was the Lee National Denim Day spokesperson.",

"biography": {
"birthName": "Margaret Elizabeth Webb",
"bio": "Libby Villari was born a Tarhill and a hick in Winston-Salem, N.C. and credits the beauty and magic of rural North Carolina for her love of, and reverence for Nature. Her roots still inform who she is today. At age 11 she moved to Sunland-Tujunga on the outskirts of Los Angeles. She embraced Southern California as her new home, graduated from Verdugo Hills High School, married, gave birth to her son, and embraced all things alternative and natural, including political activism. She became part of the \"back to the land\" movement of the 60's when she and her first husband moved to Fort Worth, Texas, settling down in the boonies outside the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolis. The idea was to own & tend land and nurture a communal way of life. Some of that worked out, and there are some great stories from that time in her life. Before returning to school at age 27, a show biz career had never entered her mind. A college scholarship in Speech lead to her B.A. in Theater from North Texas University, & upon graduation at age 30 she started her acting career. Acclaimed stage performances landed her an agent, she spent time honing her craft with the legendary Hip Pocket Theater and traveled with them to the Edinburgh, Scotland Theater Festival, she did several theater tours across the South, and in the early 90's her screen career began to take off. She's managed to cobble together a stellar career while living on a secluded North Texas Lake, far away from the limelight, with her husband of 30 years, Matt Barnes. She's worked with many acclaimed directors including Richard Linklater, Peter Berg, Robert Altman, Alan Parker, Clint Eastwood, Lasse Halstrom, Robert Rodriguez, Kimberly Pierce and James Marsh. People in the business describe Libby as earthy, authentic, sassy, irreverent, funny, and passionate about the civil liberties of ALL people and protecting the environment. She splits her time between her Texas lake home, Los Angeles, and The Smokie Mountains in North Carolina where some of her family still resides. She's recently returned to the stage to play Ann Richards in Holland Taylor's acclaimed ANN and audiences are raving about her portrayal. Libby IS Ann Richards & was born to play her.",

"biography": {
"birthName": "Ethan Green Hawke",
"height": "5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)",
"bio": "Ethan Green Hawke was born on November 6, 1970 in Austin, Texas, to Leslie Carole (Green), a charity worker, and James Steven Hawke, an insurance actuary. His parents were students at the University of Texas at the time but divorced when Ethan was 5 years old. His mother raised him alone for the next five years, moving around the country, until she remarried in 1981 and the family settled in Princeton Junction, New Jersey. He attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and then transferred to the Hun School of Princeton and it was while he was there that he began taking acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus. His early ambition had been to be a writer, but as a result of the acting lessons and appearances in student productions he persuaded his mother to allow him to attend an audition for a role in a sci-fi adolescent adventure, Explorers (1985). He got the role (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for several years. He was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society (1989) and he did not complete his degree. He then appeared in numerous films before taking a role in the Generation X drama Reality Bites (1994) for which he received critical praise. He starred in the romantic drama Before Sunrise (1995), and its later sequels Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013). His subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony Award nomination for his role in \"The Coast of Utopia\" at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of serious and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Training Day (2001). His role as the father in the coming-of-age drama Boyhood (2014) earned him multiple award nominations, including the Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actor. Meanwhile, he also wrote two novels: \"The Hottest State\" (1996) and \"Ash Wednesday\" (2002).",

"biography": {
"bio": "Charlie Wayne Sexton was born 11 August 1968, in San Antonio, Texas, to Kay and Mike Sexton. He was what many considered a musically gifted child. He signed his first record deal at MCA Records at the age of 16 and recorded his first album, \"Pictures For Pleasures\", when he met Bob Dylan. \"Pictures For Pleasures\" was released in 1985, along with a music video, \"Hold Me\", which aired on MTV in 1985. This was the first time the world outside of Austin was introduced to a man named Charlie Sexton. In 1987 Charlie toured with David Bowie on the Glass Spider Tour and the following year played backup on his brother Will's debut album, \"Will & The Kill\". In 1989 Charlie made his second album titled \"Charlie Sexton\". Charlie has appeared on soundtracks for such movies as Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), Air America (1990) and Thelma & Louise (1991). He toured with Dylan for two years as his guitarist. He joined the band Arc Angels in the early 1990s, and while with them released an album entitled \"Arc Angels\" in 1992. In 1994 he went on to have small role in the movie F.T.W. (1994), playing a cowboy named Slim. After the breakup of Arc Angels he formed Charlie Sexton & Sextet in 1995 and the group released the album \"Under the Wishing Tree\". When Charlie left the band in 2002 he went on to produce other artists' albums. In 2003 he joined Dylan once again, this time for a movie project, Masked and Anonymous (2003). Charlie produced and also played guitar and other instruments on 'Edie Brickell''s \"Volcano\" album (2003). He has stayed in the music business since he first started, with all the ups and downs that come with a music career, and has never given up on what he loves - the music. Both Charlie & Will Sexton still have as many fans all over the world as they did the day they started.",

How old do you have to be to be on TV or in a movie?\" She thought that it was just a phase, but encouraged him by signing him up for acting classes, which led to to him getting signed with an agent. Fortunately for audiences and filmmakers alike, the phase hasn't passed, as since that time, Cambell has had the pleasure of working with such acclaimed directors as Richard Linklater (on Boyhood), Kimberly Peirce (on Stop Loss), and Robert Rodriguez (on Shorts), as well as emerging filmmakers like Bryan Ortiz (on The Big Scary German and DR. S The Movie), Carl Theil (on Drawing Closer, the Grammy nominated music producer and noted film composer's directorial debut) and award-winning filmmaker at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, Pablo Veliz (on The Boys of Ghost Town). Cambell's credits also include commercial campaigns for Wal-Mart and Sears, a pilot for MTV, and several theatre credits. When he is not on stage or on screen, Cambell can be found on the field playing football, baseball, or soccer.",

"bio": "From starring in a #1-rated, syndicated children's television show, to 2 Top Ten country music videos, and a supporting role in the critically acclaimed Richard Linklater film, Boyhood, actor/recording artist Brad Hawkins has covered some ground in his career. A native of Dallas, Texas, he began his acting career in 1994 with the lead role in the children's television series V.R. Troopers (1994). Originally presented as a sister show to the worldwide hit Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1993), \"V.R. Troopers\" aired successfully for two years, achieved #1 ratings and currently airs internationally. Upon completion of the series, Brad began the move toward prime-time through guest appearances on Step by Step (1991) and Walker, Texas Ranger (1993). In 1996 he opted to take a hiatus from acting to pursue a lifelong dream in music, signing a recording contract with Curb/Universal Records in Nashville. His high-octane live show blended rock n' roll with country, and earned him opening spots with such artists as Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Toby Keith, and The Dixie Chicks. After three years Brad had performed over 400 shows and charted two #1 videos on C.M.T. and G.A.C. With these multiple successes as a foundation, he was able to break new ground in 1999, as he brought both worlds together with a starring role in the CBS miniseries, Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story (1999). \"Shake\" produced a movie soundtrack on Universal Records that included performances by B.B. King, Blink 182, K.C. & JoJo and many others. This sequence of events netted him an exclusive contract with CBS through the following summer that resulted in guest-starring roles on shows that included JAG (1995) and Touched by an Angel (1994) (the \"Touched\" episode achieved the highest ratings in its time slot). Upon completion of his contract with CBS, he moved right into production on his first feature film. Brad landed the starring role on Don't Let Go (2002) and also sang on the movie's 15-song soundtrack. \"Don't Let Go\" received \"Best Feature Film\" at the 2002 Westchester Film Festival in New York as well as \"Outstanding Achievement\" at the Stony Brook Film Festival in Long Island. He then continued on to star in Hope Ranch (2002)--an Animal Planet original movie--and _Shredder (2003) (V)_, an independent project, and appeared as a guest star in numerous hit television shows such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), NCIS (2003) and Monk (2002). His most recent appearances have included a recurring role on American Dreams (2002) as singer Brian Kessler as well as a very memorable role on the FOX series Fastlane (2002) as ruthless gangster Mick Salgado Jr. His most recent film work in \"Boyhood\" directed by Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette has collected multiple awards including 3 Golden Globes, 4 Critics Choice, and is nominated for 6 Academy Awards. Brad lives in Los Angeles working on television and film projects, developing television shows and working on his new album.",

Krause can play the guitar and says that his proudest achievement was playing a two-hour Frank Zappa tribute set with member of The Mothers of Invention. Before all that, he was a member of the Paul Green School of Rock whereas, at the peak of it, he was playing at Austin's annual prestigious music events, SXSW and the Austin City Limits Music Festival. They also were touring nationally as a member of the SOR All-Stars, which was an \"elite\" group of kids that toured regionally in order to promote what the school could do. Krause also helped found and direct the science club at his school, called TACOS, also known as the Totally Awesome and Cool Organization of Science. In three years, they went from a group of ten kids with no funding, to one of the main competitors at the state level of Science Olympiad. Krause's hero is Albert Einstein, he cannot live without his guitar and his other passions include computers and politics. He now resides in Los Angeles with his cat.",

He attended New World School of the Arts, a performing arts high-school, and acted in a variety of theatrical productions ranging from \"The Government Inspector\" to \"The Crucible\"; where he would play the tragically flawed John Proctor. In 2000, following graduation, Johnny applied and was accepted into The Goodman Theatre School for his BFA. While there, he built up a diverse resume including roles in \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\", and \"Three Sister\". He subsequently went on to perform and study in various workshops within the Chicago theatre community, working at theatre's from Chicago Shakespeare Theatre to the Steppenwolf Theatre Company. After pursuing theatre for over 10 years, Johnny decided to take a sabbatical from performing to travel and start to gain 'life-experience'. He ended up moving to be closer with his family in Austin, TX and learned a variety of skill-trades while retaining vast knowledge; such as becoming a welder, a teacher, a fish-monger, a clinical-assistant, and a carpenter. He believed that in order to fully achieve understanding about people, you have to experience what people do and who they are. After 3-4 years of living without his art, it was time to dive back into his passion. 2010 was a good year for Johnny, not just because it was the year he decided to go back into the art-form he loved, but it was also the year he had his first film debut in the Horror-flick Boneboys (2012). Since then, Johnny's film and television career has taken off.",
