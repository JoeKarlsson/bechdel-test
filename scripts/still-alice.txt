STILL ALICE
GLATZER & WESTMORELAND
ADAPTED FROM A NOVEL BY LISA GENOVA
INT. NEW YORK RESTAURANT - EVENING
In a fashionable uptown Asian-Fusion eatery, a birthday celebration takes place. At the head of the table is ALICE HOWLAND, a woman who could be said to have it all: a high- flying academic career, a successful marriage, and three healthy grown children. She is whip smart, charming, undeniably beautiful. To her right is her husband, JOHN HOWLAND, also an academic, a bear of a man with a gleam of high intelligence. To her left is her oldest daughter ANNA HOWLAND JONES, a successful lawyer, and handsome husband CHARLIE. One chair at the table is conspicuously empty.
ANNA (PRE-LAP) Okay. Happy Birthday, Mom!
Anna hands Alice a gift-wrapped bag.
ALICE Is that for me?
CHARLIE
Exactly, I don’t believe it. You
don’t even look forty, much less fifty.
ALICE
Oh Charlie, please - but thank you.
I appreciate it. Can I open this now?
ANNA
Yes, open it. Please.
Alice opens the present and gasps.
ALICE Oh! Oh I love it.
ANNA Oh good.
ALICE It’s so beautiful.
ANNA
You can exchange it if it doesn’t
fit.
ALICE
No, no, no. I’m not going to. I
absolutely love it. You always get me things I love.
PINK PAGES 1
A smart young man bearing a resemblance to John rushes up. This is TOM HOWLAND.
TOM Sorry I’m late..!
Tom kisses his mom on the cheek.
ALICE Oh hey!
Tom finds a seat.
ALICE Isn’t...um...Lisa coming?
TOM No, we split up.
ANNA
Yes, I did notice that your status
popped back to single...yet again.
He gives his sister a tight-lipped smile. Then, to Alice:
TOM
I forgot your present. Left it in
my locker.
ALICE
I just hope you didn’t spend too
much.
ANNA
Don’t worry, he didn’t.
JOHN Where have you been?
TOM
The ER was like a madhouse. This one guy came in - six stab wounds. I swear one missed his heart by, seriously, an inch.
ANNA
No. Tom, it’s dinner time. Please.
TOM Not yet it isn’t.
ANNA Nearly.
PINK PAGES 2
JOHN
So what kind of antibiotic do you
use..?
As John and Tom engage enthusiastically in a rehash of the poor guy’s trauma, Alice turns to Anna and Charlie.
ANNA
Mom, have you spoken to Lydia?
ALICE
Yes. She wanted to be here
tonight, but she had a really important audition.
ANNA What for?
ALICE
A guest spot on some TV thing.
Something Enemy. Anna shakes her head.
CHARLIE
Maybe this will be her big break.
ALICE Yeah maybe.
ANNA
Don’t hold your breath.
Meow.
CHARLIE
ANNA (laughing)
Stop it.
CHARLIE
You two must have been something
growing up. Why do I picture dolls with heads cut off?
ALICE
No, my sister and I were very
close, actually.
Charlie and Anna both look at her, a little surprised.
CHARLIE Oh...sorry...I was talking about
Anna and Lydia.
PINK PAGES 3
ALICE
Oh my goodness, I don’t know why I
said that.
Anna steps in to change the mood.
ANNA
Well we’re here to celebrate you,
Mom. So Dad, what about a toast.
She turns to her dad, who is still rattling on about E.R.
ANNA Dad, a toast?!
JOHN Oh yes, yes, yes.
They raise their glasses.
JOHN
To the most beautiful and the most
intelligent woman I have known my entire life.
ALICE Thank you.
EVERYBODY Happy Birthday!
INT. UCLA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - CORRIDOR - LOS ANGLES - DAY
We follow Alice from behind as she walks down the bright, broad corridor of the academic institution.
PROFESSOR JOHNSON (O.S.) My name is Frederick Johnson, I’m
an associate professor of cognitive science here at UCLA and I’m here to welcome today’s speaker who has just flown in from New York.
INT. FUNCTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
A lectern has been set up in front of a projection screen. About FORTY ACADEMICS are sitting, listening. Young, confident, PROFESSOR JOHNSON is introducing Alice as she waits at the side.
PINK PAGES 4
PROFESSOR JOHNSON Now in my dissertation I spent
about a chapter and a half fairly vituperatively citing today’s guest and saying why I thought she was wrong...
The audience laughs, Alice as well.
PROFESSOR JOHNSON
For the record, every time Alice and I have argued, she’s right. Alice Howland is the Lillian Young Professor of Linguistics at Columbia University. She famously wrote her seminal textbook, From Neurons to Nouns, while raising three children - I’m sure getting more than a few “Ah-ha” moments from them - and it is now considered one of the cornerstones of linguistics education all over the world. Please welcome...Dr. Alice Howland.
Warm applause from the assembled. Alice takes her place behind the lectern.
ALICE
Thank you. Thank you so much.
She taps a computer sitting on the lectern. A photo of an adorable, bright-eyed baby comes up on the screen behind her. She launches into her talk with great self-assurance.
ALICE
Most children speak and understand
their mother tongue before they turn four, without lessons, homework, or much in the way of feedback. How do they accomplish this remarkable feat? Well this is a question that has interested scientists at least since Charles Darwin kept a diary of the early language of his infant son. He observed, “Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children.”
She taps her computer - a photo of Charles Darwin comes up.
PINK PAGES 5
ALICE
Much has been learned since then but today I’m going to show you some recent studies from my lab in children between the ages of eighteen months and two and a half years.
She taps again - a picture of a toddler in a kid-friendly lab.
ALICE
Now, this might sound like it falls into the great academic tradition of knowing more and more about less and less until we know everything about nothing.
(audience chuckles)
But I hope to convince you that by taking these first baby steps into the...
The smooth, assured flow of Alice’s lecture is broken - a word isn’t forthcoming.
ALICE Into the...
The audience waits patiently.
ALICE
(deadpanning)
I knew I shouldn’t have had that champagne.
An appreciative murmur. Alice takes a slight detour round the word.
ALICE
...into the word stock of a given
language...
(hits her stride again)
...we will learn crucial information about the interaction between memory and computation that is the very essence of communication.
INT. BLACK CAR -- MOVING -- LOS ANGELES
Alice stares out the window - something is troubling her. She closes her eyes as if to squeeze out a thought.
PINK PAGES 6
ALICE (under her breath)
Lexicon!
Satisfied, she looks at a WORDS WITH FRIENDS game on her iPhone. Moving three letters, she forms the word “HADJ” on a triple.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - KOREATOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
The black car arrives at a two-story run-down Seventies apartment building.
EXT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Alice exits the elevator and walks down the corridor of the low-rent building. She passes a room where she glimpses a few young people hanging out listening to indie rock. A little further down, she finds Lydia’s door.
The door is answered by LYDIA HOWLAND, a feisty young woman with dark hair.
Hey.
Hi.
LYDIA
ALICE
LYDIA
Hey, sorry. You just caught me by
surprise. Come on in. It’s messy but I was in the process of cleaning.
INT. LYDIA’S APARTMENT
ALICE
It’s fine, honey. Don’t worry.
Alice looks around. A living room adjoins a kitchen, separated only by a counter that is cluttered with left-overs from lunch. There are some pieces of eighties thrift store furniture, some carelessly discarded men’s boots.
LYDIA
(picking up a few things)
The boys are total slobs. The kitchen is the main battleground, but I’ve got them in training. So we’ll see how that goes.
Alice glances at some photobooths on the wall - Lydia and two young men goofing for the camera.
PINK PAGES 7
ALICE So where are they?
LYDIA
At work. Doug’s at Starbucks.
Malcolm does some catering.
ALICE
I guess that’s what they mean by a
working actor?
Lydia gives a tight-lipped smile. Acting is always a sore topic for them.
INT. L.A. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The restaurant is typical Silverlake -- hipster Mexican. Lydia has finished eating. Alice is still working on it.
ALICE (PRE-LAP)
Are you involved with either one of
them?
LYDIA
Doug’s gay. And Malcolm and I did
have a thing, but it’s over. He got me in with Open Space though. It’s like the best theater company.
ALICE Yes, I heard.
Alice’s plate is taken away prematurely by a BUSBOY.
ALICE (joking)
Thank you. Yeah, I’m done.
LYDIA
It would have been awesome if you
saw ‘No Exit.’
ALICE
Daddy said you were really good.
LYDIA
I was all right. Not my best
night, but at least he got a sense of it all. Figure out why he’s doing - you know - me a solid with the company.
Alice didn’t know this. Lydia immediately realizes she shouldn’t have said anything.
PINK PAGES 8
ALICE What do you mean?
It’s just help out.
How is he company?
LYDIA
really nice of him to
ALICE
helping out with the
LYDIA
It’s our responsibility as members
to raise equity for our productions we put on. And then eventually we get a cut of the box office - it’s like we’re shareholders...
ALICE
So you have to...pay to act,
basically?
LYDIA
No. It’s a theater group. It’s just the reality of the situation. That’s how it is here. It’s Los Angeles.
ALICE
Lydia, don’t you think it’s time
you reconsidered things? You’re so smart. There’s so much more you could be doing with your life...
LYDIA (interrupting, annoyed)
Like going to college?
ALICE Yes! Like college.
LYDIA
Yeah...Like we’ve never talked
about that before...every single
PINK PAGES 9
 day of my life. I I wanted to do and It’s a good thing.
ALICE But on whose dime?
LYDIA You’re helping Tom
figured out what I’m doing it.
with Med school. You helped Anna with law.
ALICE Sweetheart...those are real
careers. I just don’t want you to limit your choices.
LYDIA
You want to make my choices.
ALICE No, I don’t.
LYDIA I’m really happy.
ALICE
I’m sorry. I don’t - I don’t want
to argue about this. Just forget I said anything.
LYDIA It’s forgotten.
A noise dings on Alice’s phone.
LYDIA
You going to check your phone?
Alice looks at the phone.
ALICE
It’s just a game. Your sister and
I have developed an obsession with Words with Friends.
LYDIA
(feeling a bit left out)
That’s cute.
ALICE (reading this)
Believe me, you don’t want to play her. She’s a demon.
LYDIA I’m not surprised.
Alice sighs and looks for a way to re-start the conversation. EXT. TOWN CAR - MOVING - AFTERNOON
Alice is travelling, once again, now through the streets of New York.
PINK PAGES 10
INT. ALICE’S HOME - ENTRY WAY
She enters with her bags and closes the door behind her.
ALICE John? Hi.
INT. KITCHEN
Depositing her keys in a goldfish bowl, she glances at a small memory board on the wall. No note has been left for her.
ALICE John?
She gets her iPhone out of her bag and texts John:
TEXT Where R U?
EXT. UPTOWN STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
Now in athletic wear, Alice runs down the cold street. She navigates around PEDESTRIANS and MOMS WITH STROLLERS.
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK
In the light of the late afternoon, she runs through the trees on a familiar path.
EXT. COLUMBIA CAMPUS -- DAY
Students and academics are going about their business. A young STREET VENDOR is passing out leaflets calling, “Sale at the Shoe Warehouse.”
Alice runs into the center of the square then slows down. Suddenly, she’s not sure of where she is.
TIGHT CLOSE-UP OF ALICE
THE DEPTH OF FIELD has become very shallow, completely isolating her from her surroundings. The normal University soundscape fades away disconcertingly. She looks from one building to another - from one person to another. Things swim momentarily into focus but there’s no context - no bigger picture. Her breathing starts to quicken.
She ventures one way a few paces, up some stairs. Her breathing is rapid, her face flushed with fear. She puts her head down, forcing herself to focus.
PINK PAGES 11
Then, she recognizes the Columbia Library Building in front of her. Normality returns. People walk by her, chatting. Everything is in focus now.
She heads towards her home.
Want one?
STREET VENDOR
ALICE No thanks.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - ENTRYWAY
There’s the sound of a key in the door.
Ali...
JOHN (O.S.)
From the kitchen area, John appears, hair messy, a day’s stubble visible. Alice enters, trying not to show the turmoil she’s feeling.
JOHN
I was wondering where you were.
He goes to hug her.
ALICE
Don’t. I’m all sweaty.
JOHN How did it go?
What?
ALICE
Alice heads to the kitchen. INT. KITCHEN
JOHN UCLA..?
ALICE
Good. They were really...receptive.
JOHN
I’m sure they were. And how was
Lydia?
ALICE Good, y’know...
PINK PAGES 12
JOHN You guys argue?
ALICE
Well we spent the whole evening
trying not to. You know, I have to say the news that you were bank- rolling her theatre company didn’t exactly help.
JOHN
I told you about that.
ALICE You didn’t.
JOHN I thought I did.
ALICE You didn’t.
JOHN
Well...you’re not gonna like this
either, but I still have a lot of things to do at the lab. So maybe you could walk me over there right now...
ALICE (annoyed)
No. I don’t want to go to campus. I just went for a run. I really need to be home now.
JOHN
(a flicker of concern)
Are you okay?
ALICE
Yeah, I’m fine. I just - you said
we were going to spend the evening in.
JOHN
I did - and we will. The sooner I
go, the sooner I’ll be back. And we can watch a movie.
Alice takes a breath.
ALICE
I’m sorry. I’m just exhausted.
PINK PAGES 13
He kisses her on the forehead and heads off.
JOHN
Get some rest. Try to relax.
John walks out.
INT. DR. BENJAMIN’S OFFICE - DAY
Alice sits in a chair being questioned by DR. BENJAMIN, an unseen Neurologist. In one long take, we see her trademark confidence start to erode.
ALICE (PRE-LAP)
I’ve started forgetting things.
Little annoying things likes words and names. And I got lost - completely lost - running on campus. I talked to my doctor about it and she said it could be menopause and the last time I had a period was in February but then I had one in September right before my birthday so...
DR. BENJAMIN
Are you taking any pills, any
medication, supplements?
ALICE
I take a multivitamin,
oil, calcium, iron and a sleeping pill when I
flax seed occasionally travel.
DR. BENJAMIN
Have you had any head injuries?
No.
ALICE
DR. BENJAMIN Would you consider yourself
depressed, or under undue stress at the moment?
ALICE
No. I work a lot but I thrive on
it.
How’s your sleeping?
DR. BENJAMIN
PINK PAGES 14
ALICE
It’s fine. Like seven hours a
night.
DR. BENJAMIN
Now I’m going to ask you to
remember a name and address. I’ll ask you for it again later, okay?
(she nods)
John Black, 42 Washington Street, Hoboken. Can you repeat that for me?
ALICE
John Black, 42 Washington Street,
Hoboken.
DR. BENJAMIN Good. How old are you?
ALICE I’m fifty.
DR. BENJAMIN What’s today’s date?
ALICE November 26th.
DR. BENJAMIN Where are we?
ALICE
We are on the third floor of New
York Presbyterian.
DR. BENJAMIN
Can you spell ‘water’ for me?
ALICE W-A-T-E-R.
DR. BENJAMIN
Now spell it for me backwards.
ALICE R-E-T-A-W.
DR. BENJAMIN
Can you tell me what you see on
these cards?
PINK PAGES 15
ALICE
Pliers. A ladder. A sea horse. A
screwdriver. An elephant.
It seems absurd for Alice to be answering such childish questions.
DR. BENJAMIN Tell me about your parents.
ALICE
They’re both dead. My mother and
sister died in a car accident when I was eighteen. My father died in 1999 of liver failure.
Hepatitis?
DR. BENJAMIN
ALICE
Cirrhosis. He was an alcoholic.
DR. BENJAMIN
And what was he like towards the
end?
It’s an uncomfortable subject for Alice.
ALICE
Incoherent. Incontinent. To tell
you the truth we didn’t see a lot of each other. He lived in New Hampshire and...we weren’t that close.
DR. BENJAMIN Sorry. Do you have any other
siblings?
ALICE
No. I only had the one.
DR. BENJAMIN
Now can you tell me the name and address I asked you to remember?
A wall. Alice tries to recall.
ALICE Um...John Black.
DR. BENJAMIN And the address?
PINK PAGES 16
She takes a moment.
ALICE Damn it, I forgot.
DR. BENJAMIN
42 Argyle street, Cole Street,
Washington Street or South Street? A pause. She shakes her head.
ALICE
I was distracted, talking about my
parents. Can we do that one again?
DR. BENJAMIN
There’s no need to at this time.
ALICE Okay.
DR. BENJAMIN
I’d like to do an MRI, just to rule some things out.
ALICE
Like what? Because I think I have a
brain tumor.
DR. BENJAMIN
It’s just a precaution. But it
will also allow us to see if there are any lesions or signs of a stroke. Find out what’s going on in there.
Alice nods, absorbing this.
ALICE
Okay - what should I do in the
meantime?
DR. BENJAMIN
You can get plenty of exercise.
It’s always good to get the blood pumping. And drink lots of water, hydration is excellent for the memory.
Alice takes this in.
PINK PAGES 17
DR. BENJAMIN
And the next time that you come and
see me, can you bring in someone that knows you well? Your husband or a close relative?
After a brief hesitation, Alice nods.
ALICE Okay.
EXT. ALICE’S NEIGBORHOOD -- DAY
Snow has fallen. The busy streets of New York are suddenly, and magically, quiet.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
We see winter squash chopped; brussel sprouts peeled, a turkey in the oven being checked.
Alice is busily preparing Christmas dinner. A timer rings. She goes over to the far wall murmuring...
ALICE
Stethoscope. Millennium. Hedgehog.
Lifting a dish cloth on a memory board, she checks three words - Stethoscope. Millennium. Hedgehog.
Erasing the words, she thinks a moment and writes, “Cathode, Pomegranate, Trellis.”
She places the cloth back over the words and resets the timer.
MOMENTS LATER
Alice is peeling carrots. There’s the sound of someone coming in the front door.
Hello!
TOM (O.S.)
ALICE Hi. Come on in.
Tom appears with a new GIRLFRIEND.
TOM Hey Mom.
ALICE Good to see you.
PINK PAGES 18
TOM This is Jenny.
ALICE
I’m Alice. I’m so happy you could
join us.
JENNY
Thank you for having me.
ALICE
Of course. Sweetheart, why don’t
you guys go in the and get a drink and grab the - cheese thing. All right? I’m so happy you could join, I really am, Jenny.
JENNY Thank you.
Tom and Jenny head to the living room. INT. LIVING ROOM
JENNY
It smells so good in here.
TOM Beautiful.
Tom admires the table spread.
INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
Alice assembles milk, sugar, white chocolate, challah bread on the counter. She opens a box of eggs and stares blankly at them.
ALICE (to herself)
How many goddam eggs..? The timer goes off again.
ALICE
Cathode. Pomegranate...Trellis.
She goes over to the memory board, checks the results. Right again! She erases the words as Lydia appears.
LYDIA Hey Mom!
PINK PAGES 19
ALICE Hey!!
They hug warmly.
LYDIA Merry Christmas.
ALICE
Aw, Merry Christmas.
ALICE
How was your flight?
LYDIA
Actually awful. This guy coughed
all over me the entire time.
ALICE
I hope you don’t get sick.
Lydia glances at the ingredients on the counter.
LYDIA
Does this mean what I think it
means?
ALICE
Yes.
LYDIA Bread pudding!
ALICE It’s your favorite.
ANNA (O.S.) Mom! Merry Christmas!
Anna and Charlie enter the kitchen in expensive casual-wear contrasting with Lydia’s thrift-store chic. Anna hugs her mother.
ANNA
Have you seen my latest Words With
Friends?
ALICE
Oh no. I haven’t had time yet,
sweetheart.
ANNA It’s a real zinger.
PINK PAGES 20
CHARLIE JEALOUSY on a triple.
ANNA Don’t spoil it.
CHARLIE
It’s already trending on Twitter.
Lydia greets her sister.
Alice is distracted, staring at the bread pudding ingredients, as the sisters attempt some friendly conversation.
ANNA How’s California?
LYDIA It’s great.
ANNA Warmer than here..?
LYDIA
Yes. Definitely warmer than here.
ALICE
Okay now, all get outta here. I
have to concentrate or there’ll be no food.
LYDIA Where’s dad?
ALICE He’s upstairs.
Lydia goes into the living room.
ANNA
Can I help you with anything?
ALICE
No, I’m fine. Just go get a drink
or something.
ANNA
Okay. It’s going to be delicious.
ALICE Oh I hope so.
PINK PAGES 21
ANNA
It will be. I can’t wait.
Anna and Tom go into the living room. Alice checks her phone for a bread pudding recipe.
INT. DINING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
Anna, Charlie, John, Tom and his girlfriend, are seated drinking wine.
ANNA
It’s a very big decision. We’re
excited. The place was recommended by a couple of friends who’d been trying for years and have just had their first child. So we’ll see...
JOHN
I’ve heard good things about
Wellspring.
ANNA
Good. It’s expensive, but we
obviously want it to work.
TOM
I can’t believe you’re going to be
a Mom.
ANNA I know!!
They carry on chatting as Alice enters carrying a soup tureen.
ALICE Here we are...
She places the tureen in the center of the table.
LYDIA
What kind of soup is it?
ALICE
It’s butternut squash.
LYDIA Nice!
Alice notices Jenny sitting next to Tom.
PINK PAGES 22
ALICE
Hi, I’m Alice. I’m so happy you
could join us.
JENNY I’m - Jenny.
Jenny looks a little startled. Lydia glances over at her. Alice takes a breath.
ALICE
It’s really nice to meet you. Well
I think I deserve a glass of wine after all that, don’t you?
LYDIA You want white?
ALICE
Yes. Thank you. Does everyone
have a glass?
ANNA Yes, we do!
ALICE
Let’s have a toast. To Christmas!!
ALL Merry Christmas.
They clink glasses.
INT. DR. BENJAMIN’S OFFICE - DAY
Alice is nervously listening as the doctor reviews her file.
DR. BENJAMIN (PRE-LAP) No cerebral vascular disease, no
evidence of any stroke, no masses.
ALICE (under her breath)
Thank God.
DR. BENJAMIN
And your blood work came back completely clear. But what worries me are the memory tests that I sent you for. You have sporadic memory impairment totally out of proportion to your age and there is evidence of decline in your level of mental function.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 23
DR. BENJAMIN (cont'd)
I think we should do a PET scan. It’s similar to an MRI but it can pick up things at the molecular level...
ALICE (interrupting)
I know what a PET scan is but what in particular are you looking for?
DR. BENJAMIN
I want to see if the results are
consistent with Alzheimer’s disease. It would be rare for someone as young as yourself. But you do fit the criteria.
Alice nods, absorbing this.
DR. BENJAMIN
Now last time you came I asked you
to bring a close relative.
ALICE
I really didn’t think that would be
necessary.
DR. BENJAMIN
Next time, for sure. Okay..?
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
John is at the counter top, reading e-mails on his computer. At the sink, scrubbing a pot, Alice responds to him almost on autopilot.
JOHN “...enhancement of endogenous
levels of beta endorphin has not so far been shown to reduce the incidence of metastasis in the distant cell sites.”
ALICE That’s not good.
JOHN
Tell me about it. We’ve been
working on this for months! “The beta-endorphin doesn’t significantly impact the microphage activity”...
PINK PAGES 24
ALICE
How about the cytokines?
JOHN
Elevated. Slightly. Oh god back
to square one. Are we both here on the seventeenth?
ALICE I don’t remember.
JOHN
Phil and Diane were saying they
might come to town for the weekend.
No reply. John looks up at her. She is still determinedly scrubbing.
JOHN
How long are you going to keep at
that thing?
ALICE Until it’s clean...
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
John is sleeping soundly. Unable to sleep, Alice looks at the clock. It’s 2.15.
INT. BATHROOM - LATER
She enters, switching on the too-bright light, then looks at herself in the mirror, face scrunched. Opening the bathroom cabinet, she takes out some sleeping pills.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
It’s now 4:35 a.m. Alice remains awake. Her eyes open, her thoughts racing. Deliberately, she turns on the bedside lamp and touches John’s shoulder.
ALICE
John...John, sweetheart. Wake up.
He groans, shifts around under the covers. He groggily opens his eyes.
JOHN
Hmmm... What time is it?
ALICE
I need to talk to you...I’ve...I’ve
got something wrong with me.
PINK PAGES 25
He gradually starts to wake up.
JOHN
What are you talking about..?
ALICE
I’ve been seeing a neurologist.
JOHN
You’ve been seeing a neurologist?
Why?
ALICE
They think it might be early onset
Alzheimer’s.
JOHN
What? That, that makes absolutely
no sense.
ALICE
I didn’t want to tell you because
they don’t know anything for sure but I’ve been doing all these tests and I’m really scared.
John sits up in bed.
JOHN
Ali, that is completely insane.
ALICE
I got lost when I was running on
campus awhile ago. I can’t remember appointments. Words...
JOHN
Honey, we all have memory lapses.
That’s a sign of getting older. The other day I forgot the word - ‘glucose.’
ALICE
It’s not like that. It’s like
something just drops out under me.
JOHN
But there’s no diagnosis yet?
No.
ALICE
PINK PAGES 26
JOHN
Well I think that this is
ridiculous. It’s complete bullshit, you don’t have Alzheimer’s.
He reaches out again for her, but she pulls away. Her emotion, stoked by a sleepless night and a failed Ambien, turns to anger.
ALICE
God dammit! Why won’t you take me
seriously? I know what I’m feeling. And it feels like my brain is fucking dying. And everything I’ve worked for in my entire life is going. It’s all going...
JOHN
Come here don’t cry.
In his eyes we see care and concern but also the first signs of reckoning.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Alice sits at the counter in a baggy sweatshirt. John is dutifully preparing some cereal. They both look exhausted.
JOHN
What time is your tutorial?
ALICE Eleven.
JOHN
Well, that gives you some time.
I’m going to be a little late because I have a departmental meeting. But when I get back maybe we can do dinner, have some Thai food?
ALICE
Yeah. Okay. I’m okay...last night
just got the better of me, that’s all.
Their routine conversation seems almost stripped of meaning, yet they do what people do - they carry on.
PINK PAGES 27
JOHN
Well two things; I think it’s way
too early to jump to any conclusions and whatever happens, I’m here.
She looks at him, weighing him, wondering about the future.
INT. DOCTOR BENJAMIN’S OFFICE
A computer shows a brightly colored cross-section of a brain. Alice’s brain.
DR. BENJAMIN
You can clearly see in here. The
red areas are high in beta amyloid. The build up has probably been ongoing for several years. I’m sorry.
John sits beside Alice. He is not buying it.
JOHN
There is evidence of high amyloid
in older people with normal cognitive functioning, correct?
DR. BENJAMIN
Yes but not in someone as young as
Alice. At least, it would be extremely rare.
JOHN
I also read that high amyloid is
associated with conditions other than Alzheimer’s.
DR. BENJAMIN Unfortunately, in Alice’s case this
corroborates the clinical symptoms she’s presenting.
JOHN
Shouldn’t any diagnosis be
accompanied by a genetic test?
ALICE
John, hold on a minute, please.
DR. BENJAMIN Actually, I was going to suggest
that.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 28
DR. BENJAMIN (cont'd)
In a case like this - with the onset being so early - we’d like to check for presenilin mutations. That would be an indicator of Familial Alzheimer’s Disease which is a rarer form. We can make an appointment for you to see a genetic counsellor.
This news really hits Alice. When she speaks, it takes an effort to control her voice.
ALICE
So this concerns my children too?
Yes.
DR. BENJAMIN
ALICE
I assume if I have the gene, the
chances of passing it on to each one is fifty-fifty?
DR. BENJAMIN I’m afraid so.
ALICE
And if they are carrying the gene,
what are the odds of them developing the disease?
DR. BENJAMIN I’m afraid it’s 100%.
She nods, still trying to stay calm as her eyes betray a rush of emotion.
INT. MEDICAL BUILDING ELEVATORS -- DAY
Alice and John wait by the elevators. There’s a tremendous weight upon them. For a moment, neither can speak.
ALICE
The kids will be here for our
anniversary.
JOHN
I don’t think we should tell them.
Not until we have the test results.
ALICE
Wewillbythen. IfIgoinnext
week...
PINK PAGES 29
Suddenly, John leans forward and punches the button.
JOHN
Where the hell is this goddam
elevator? Here we are in a major hospital, and they only have one elevator running.
ALICE John, it’s okay.
JOHN
We could have taken the stairs by
now.
ALICE It doesn’t matter.
The elevator arrives and they get in silently.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Anna, Charlie and Tom are on the couch, Lydia sits apart. Alice wants to make an announcement but the words just won’t come.
ALICE Well, um everybody...
TOM What’s going on?
ALICE Oh boy.
She looks at John.
LYDIA
Are you guys breaking up, or...
ALICE
No. It’s nothing like that.
ANNA
Mom are you sick..?
ALICE
I’ve been seeing a neurologist for the past few months and I have Alzheimer’s disease. Early onset.
There is a sense of unease and shock in the room.
PINK PAGES 30
TOM That...That makes Are you sure? It
JOHN There’s no doubt.
no sense.
may be... She has the
disease.
TOM
But at her age...
JOHN
It’s rare but it’s been confirmed.
ANNA
(tearing up)
You’re so young Mom. I don’t understand that.
LYDIA
I had noticed one or two things.
You didn’t know Tom’s girlfriend when she came over at Christmas--
ANNA
(under her breath)
Lydia!
Anna shakes her head at Lydia.
TOM
What medications are you on?
ALICE
Right now Aricept and Numenda.
TOM
And they can slow its progress?
ALICE
No.
I’m afraid not. They can help alleviate the symptoms but not actually prevent the disease.
ALICE
John! The thing is that the type
of Alzheimers I have is very rare. And, well, it’s familial -- it’s passed on genetically.
JOHN
(as Alice tries to talk)
PINK PAGES 31
ANNA Oh my god.
JOHN
We believe she got it from her
father. And of course we’re very worried about the three of you. Now there is a test you can take. But it’s completely up to you whether you want to find out or not.
Anna starts to cry. Lydia sits on her own, quietly reckoning.
ALICE
I’m sorry. I’m sorry...
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Alice reaches for a pill container with different capsules for each day of the week. She empties out Wednesday, starts to down them with water.
John passes by the doorway. He doesn’t like to watch her regimen.
INT. COLUMBIA LECTURE HALL - DAY
TWO DOZEN STUDENTS are waiting. Alice enters, flustered, opens the computer and clicks on the folder that says “Linguistics Classes.” It contains six files: Syntax, Acquisition, Semantics, Comprehension, Phonology, and Pathologies.
Looking at the list, she is momentarily confused - which lecture is she giving? Meanwhile, her students are starting to get restless.
ALICE
Can anyone tell me what it says on
the syllabus for today?
A few hands shoot up and a voice calls out “Phonology.”
ALICE
And can anyone tell me what
phonology is..?
No answers. She clicks on the appropriate file.
PINK PAGES 32
ALICE
“Phono” is from the Greek word “phoné” meaning sound, and phonology, broadly speaking, is the study of the sounds of language. It should be carefully distinguished from phonetics...
EXT. COLUMBIA CAMPUS -- DAY
Bundled up against the cold, Alice walks briskly across the campus. Her phone goes off. It’s Anna.
ALICE Hi Anna.
Hi Mom.
ANNA (O.S.)
ALICE Are you okay?
ANNA (O.S.)
I got the results, I’m positive.
ALICE
Oh God, Anna. I’m sorry. I’m so
so sorry.
ANNA
Tom turned out negative and Lydia
didn’t want to know. But I’m positive.
ALICE
Baby, how you feeling?
ANNA
I’m okay. One good thing, at least
I found out now before the next IUI session. I guess there’s a way they can test the embryos. So we can be sure - that the baby’ll be okay.
ALICE
Anna, where are you? I’ve got a
lecture but I can cancel it and I can be right there.
ANNA
No no, Mom. It’s okay. I’m with
Charlie.
PINK PAGES 33
ALICE
No, I want to. I want to be there.
I can come.
ANNA
No, please don’t worry. I’ll be
fine.
ALICE
Okay. I love you, sweetheart.
ANNA I love you.
Bye.
ALICE
ANNA Bye.
She walks off across the campus alone. INT. ALICE’S HOME - KITHCEN -- DAY
Alice reaches into the fridge and stops for a moment. There’s a bottle of shampoo on the top shelf. She picks it up and looks at it.
INT. LIBRARY BUILDING -- DAY
Back at the university, Alice walks round the rotunda.
INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - HEAD OF DEPARTMENT’S OFFICE - DAY
The Head of Department, ERIC WELLMAN, is an avuncular fifty year-old with an intimating air. He reads from his computer.
ERIC WELLMAN
“I had been looking forward to this
course my sophomore year but I was thoroughly disappointed. The content was often muddled and delivered with little focus or care.”
Alice listens uncomfortably.
ERIC WELLMAN
“Class was a waste of time. I
ended up just following the on-line version.”
(then the next)
“I found Linguistics 201 very erratic.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 34
ERIC WELLMAN (cont'd)
I had a hard time following Dr. Howland’s lectures--even she seems like she gets lost in them.”
Eric turns to her. Alice looks down.
ALICE
Eric, I am so sorry. I - I didn’t
know the students felt this way. Obviously I will make the necessary adjustments and we can reevaluate my performance next semester.
ERIC WELLMAN
Listen, is everything okay at home?
Is everything all right between you and John?
ALICE
Yes, everything is fine with John.
ERIC WELLMAN
Is it something we can help with?
Stress, depression--
ALICE
No. It’s not that...
ERIC WELLMAN Substance abuse?
ALICE
Oh god, no. Eric...No it’s nothing
like that. It’s, uh, it’s medical. It’s a medical issue. And I admit I had a hard time teaching last semester and I wasn’t aware of how much it showed.
ERIC WELLMAN Alice, I’m not following.
ALICE
I have a mild cognitive impairment.
ERIC WELLMAN
Would you unpack that for me?
ALICE
In early February I was diagnosed
with Early Onset Alzheimer’s disease.
PINK PAGES 35
ERIC WELLMAN
What? Alice...Oh my God. I’m so
sorry.
ALICE
It’s early. It’s still in the
early stages. I mean obviously it will limit my abilities as time goes on but for now I feel perfectly capable...
ERIC WELLMAN (he takes a breath)
Really there’s no need to...We don’t want you under any undue stress. That would be counterproductive.
ALICE
I can handle the stress. I would
like to remain in the department for as long as we all think it’s possible.
He looks at her, takes a breath.
ERIC WELLMAN
I’ll have to let the department and
faculty know Alice nods, absorbing this.
ALICE Yes, of course.
ERIC WELLMAN I’m so so sorry.
EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - LATE AFTERNOON
Once again, Alice runs on the streets.
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK
Alice’s breath comes in clouds as she runs beneath the trees. INT. STREETS OF NEW YORK
She slows down, out of breath, and sees something ahead.
A FAMILY is coming out of a Pinkberry Frozen Yoghurt shop. After a moments thought, she walks toward the brightly lit franchise.
PINK PAGES 36
INT. PINKBERRY
Looking at the array of toppings, Alice orders.
ALICE
I’ll have a regular with blueberry
and coconut, please. MOMENTS LATER
Alice sits on her own, eating her frozen yoghurt.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT
When Alice comes in the front door, John is irate.
Hi.
ALICE
JOHN
Alice, where the hell were you?
ALICE I went for a run.
JOHN
But you’ve been gone for over two
hours. I was worried.
ALICE
I stopped for Pinkberry.
JOHN Pinkberry?
ALICE Yes, Pinkberry.
She heads into the living room. John follows. INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
JOHN
Well I hope it was worth it because
you completely blew our dinner plans - Susan Kirby and her husband.
ALICE
I’m sorry. I forgot. I have
Alzheimer’s.
She looks at him boldly. For a moment he’s at a loss for words. He looks away.
PINK PAGES 37
JOHN
I texted you. I e-mailed you. There
are lots of ways of managing this.
ALICE
John, I said I was sorry.
JOHN
She’s chair of my department, for
crying out loud. I had absolutely no idea where you were, if something had happened to you. Why didn’t you bring your phone?
ALICE
I can’t while I’m running.
JOHN
Why don’t you wear a fanny pack?
Is it really so inhibiting?
Yes!
ALICE
She sighs heavily and sits on the sofa.
ALICE
I hate that this is happening to me.
JOHN I hate it too.
He sits opposite her.
JOHN
But we have to keep the important
things in our life going. We have to try or we’re going to go crazy.
ALICE
I know. I know, John. I am sorry.
But I don’t know what I would have been like at a dinner party. I might not be able to remember names or answer simple questions, never mind get through an anecdote.
JOHN
I think you’re doing great
recently.
ALICE Relative to what?
PINK PAGES 38
They look at each other.
ALICE
I wish I had cancer.
JOHN Don’t say that.
ALICE
No, I do. I mean it. I wouldn’t
feel so ashamed. When people have
cancer they wear pink ribbons for
you and go on long walks and raise
money. And you don’t have to feel
like some kind of a - social...I
can’t remember the word. *
EXT. MOUNT AUBURN NURSING CENTER - DAY
Winter has ended, the air is warm, birds are singing.
Alice heads toward a large building bordered with sprouting crocuses and budding bushes.
INT. MOUNT AUBURN NURSING CENTER - ENTRANCE/CORRIDOR
Alice walks from a reception area down a broad corridor with TRACEY FREDERICKS, an African-American CAREWORKER. A few OLD FOLK shuffle around as a COUPLE OF ORDERLIES go about their business.
CAREWORKER
In 2013 we completed repairs and
inside we replaced the elevators, refurbished the auditorium, library and lounge area and upgraded our HVAC system.
ALICE That’s good.
CAREWORKER
We also took away most of the old
security doors. Residents are issued a bracelet instead, which keeps them from using elevators or leaving the building - depending on their level. I don’t know if you’ve experienced this yet with your parent, but a lot of times they get nighttime restlessness and wandering.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 39
CAREWORKER (cont'd)
This way, we can prevent their elopement without our patients feeling they are locked in.
ALICE I see.
INT. COMMON ROOM -- DAY
Many OLD PEOPLE stare into space or hum to themselves. One old lady puts curlers into another one’s hair.
CAREWORKER
We saw after a while that large group activities left most residents unengaged and even distressed by the confusion they experienced from all the stimulation. So we redefined activities to include all interactions between staff and residents in the unit. All the staff looks for opportunities to make a meaningful connection with residents, starting with knowing about the person who they’ve been, and what makes them comfortable. One resident who had worked as a nurse sat part of most days at the nursing station, writing notes.
ALICE That’s heartbreaking.
CAREWORKER
Yes but its a behavior we see time
and again. (Alice nods)
We don’t have any restrictions on visiting times. Friends and family are welcome any hour of day or night.
ALICE
It doesn’t look like anyone is here
today.
CAREWORKER
Well, Sunday’s the day they usually come by.
An alarm goes off. Across the room, an OLD LADY is up out of her wheelchair in an agitated state. A SECOND CAREWORKER tries to calm her.
PINK PAGES 40
CAREWORKER (talking over her)
That’s a chair alarm. Certain residents have them so we know when they’re up and about.
The Old Lady is seated once more in the chair and the alarm is silenced.
ALICE Is she all right?
CAREWORKER
It’s just a precautionary measure.
ALICE It’s all women.
CAREWORKER
We do have mainly female residents
here but there are a couple of gentlemen. There’s William over there - William was part of the team that sent the first satellite into orbit.
William is nearly bent double, shuffling towards a table using his walker. This really gets to Alice.
“BUTTERFLY” SEQUENCE
A WHITE SCREEN
Words appear quickly typed on a iPhone:
ALICE, ANSWER THESE THREE QUESTIONS.
1) WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR OLDEST DAUGHTER?
INT. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN’S OFFICE
ALICE
They just aren’t powerful enough to
send me to sleep.
DOCTOR
Do you want to try Lunesta?
ALICE How about Rohypnol?
PINK PAGES 41
DOCTOR They’re very strong...
ALICE
I need something strong.
ON THE WHITE SCREEN
2) WHAT STREET DO YOU LIVE ON?
INT. HOME OFFICE
Alice has plugged a small video camera into her computer. She reaches to press RECORD then sits in front of the camera.
ALICE
Hi Alice. I’m you and I have
something very important to say to you.
INT. MOUNT AUBURN MANOR NURSING CENTER--LOBBY
Alice types questions onto her phone (dialogue from previous scene continues)
ON THE WHITE SCREEN
3) WHAT MONTH IS YOUR BIRTHDAY?
ALICE (V.O.)
So I guess you’ve reached that
point - the point that you can no longer answer any of the questions.
INT. ALICE’S HOME--OFFICE
Alice continues making the recording.
ALICE
So this it the next logical step.
I’m sure of it.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - MASTER BEDROOM
Alice writes a note to herself.
ALICE (V.O.)
In your bedroom is a dresser with a
blue lamp. Open the top drawer. In the back of the drawer there is a bottle with pills in it. It says take all pills with water.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 42
ALICE (V.O.) (cont'd)
Now there are a lot of pills in that bottle. But it’s very important that you swallow them all.
Alice attaches a label to the bottle of prescription pills. She puts them at the back of her dressing table drawer, behind bits and pieces of jewelry and accessories.
Then something catches her eye: an old pendant of a small enamel butterfly, brightly colored, a bit gaudy. She takes it out and weighs it in her hand.
INT. ALICE’S HOME -- OFFICE
Alice finishes up the video and drags it to a folder on her desktop labelled ‘Butterfly.’
ALICE (V.O.)
Okay? And then lie down, and go to
sleep...And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing.
ON THE WHITE SCREEN
WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS GO TO A FILE ON YOUR COMPUTER LABELLED BUTTERFLY
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Suddenly, Alice awakens. She’s been napping, curled up on a big old sofa. There’s the sound of waves. She looks around - a little disoriented.
She sees a BOWL OF SHELLS on the table in front of her and a MEMORY IMPAIRED bracelet on her wrist.
Slowly, she gets up and wanders towards the french doors. Stepping out on the balcony, she sees the ocean.
EXT. LIDO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON
Alice walks along the virtually abandoned beach. Down by the water’s edge, she takes in the massive beautiful landscape.
MOMENTS LATER she is sitting on a rock. A hundred yards away, John comes running.
JOHN Ali!
He joins her on the rock. They sit for a moment looking out at the sea.
PINK PAGES 43
JOHN I love it here.
ALICE
I know. I love it too.
They move in for a tender kiss. The song, “If I had a Boat,” comes up on the soundtrack.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alice and John are in the bedroom, laughing together.
ALICE Remember Santorini?
JOHN
Can you believe that was 30 years
ago?
ALICE
Don’t do that to me - oh my god.
Oh that was a complicated time, huh?
JOHN
What was it - about a year after?
ALICE
Yeah. Something like that.
JOHN
I know I’ve said this to you
before, but I am sorry I never got to meet your mother and your sister.
ALICE Me too.
(she sighs)
We had a great time though.
JOHN Yeah.
She shifts a little and looks up at him.
ALICE
Don’t you ever wish we’d had more
of that?
JOHN
If you mean blow jobs on the beach,
yes I do wish we had more of that.
PINK PAGES 44
ALICE
You know, yeah all of it. It all
happened so fast, you know. Anna was born, our careers.
JOHN
You were pretty relentless. You
wanted everything and all at once.
ALICE
That’s how I am. That’s how I like
it. Anna’s the same way, right.
JOHN
I like the way you are. I like
everything about you.
She comes to kiss him and they roll over together.
ALICE
This is so great you know. I kind
of like it, being liberated from Columbia. Why don’t you take a sabbatical next year?
JOHN
And we’re going to do
around the country in
ALICE Sure. I don’t know.
what, tour an R.V?
Spend more time here. Go to Bhutan.
JOHN
I think our summer on the Island is
all the excitement I can handle right now.
ALICE
Well, you know what, this might be
the last year that I’m myself, you know...
This brings John up short.
JOHN
Please don’t say that.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE--LIVING ROOM
Alice answers the questions on her phone.

INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - LIVING AREA - MORNING
Alice finishes up her daily memory-check on her iPhone. Then, gets up and walks out of the door.
EXT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - GARAGE - MORNING It’s a foggy, overcast morning.
ALICE John...
JOHN (O.S.) I’m over here.
John, down below, planting some shrubs in the garden.
ALICE
Hey when do you leave for the
conference?
JOHN On Monday.
ALICE
And when is Lydia coming?
JOHN
Lydia comes on Sunday.
ALICE
She doesn’t have to come all that
way to baby-sit me.
JOHN
Well shes’s coming to do the Chekhov
play at the Saugatuck, remember? She looks around at the misty morning.
ALICE ...Right.
PINK PAGES 46
JOHN
When I get finished are we still
going to go for a run?
ALICE
Yeah, I just need to grab another
layer.
She heads inside.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM
Entering the master bedroom, she goes over to a large dresser. She opens a drawer, digs around and finds what she is looking for - a lightweight top. It’s a bit more colorful than her taste usually runs.
She puts it on over her T-shirt, turns, and notices something.
It’s a photo album of her childhood, with fading photos and Polaroids, held in place by yellowing cellophane.
EXT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BALCONY - MINUTES LATER Alice sits, studying the photo album.
In one photo, her MOTHER, a woman in her thirties, and her sister ANNE, mid-teens, are on the beach, smiling for the camera. Turn a page, and there is young Alice eating dinner, her mouth full of spaghetti.
Another page and there is her FATHER, giving the camera a slightly askew smile. Alice ponders him for a moment.
JOHN (O.S.)
Hey, are we still going running?
He appears from inside.
ALICE
I’m sorry. Hey look I found this
photo album with these pictures of my mother and my sister.
(John nods patiently)
Hey, when are you going to the conference?
JOHN Monday.
ALICE
And when is Lydia coming?
PINK PAGES 47
JOHN
Lydia is coming Sunday. ALICE
Ok.
JOHN
Are we going running?
ALICE
Yes we are, I just have to go pee. I’ll be right back.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - UPSTAIRS
Alice walks in but feels disoriented, suddenly unsure of
where she is.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - HALLWAY/LIVING AREA
She comes downstairs, looks into the kitchen, then makes her way to the hallway, trying doors but not finding the bathroom. There’s a closet. Then Lydia’s room. Then an office.
Hurrying towards the living room again, she becomes more and more anxious. She tries the door to her right -- the closet again.
CLOSE ON ALICE
Her skin is flushed, reddening with humiliation. John rushes down the stairs.
JOHN Alice!
She is standing by the hallway, her sweat pants soaked in urine.
JOHN Ali...
ALICE
I couldn’t find the bathroom.
JOHN
It’s okay, baby. Come on, let’s get
you cleaned up.
ALICE
...I don’t know where I am.
PINK PAGES 48
She starts to cry. John puts his arm round her and they go upstairs.
EXT. LIDO BEACH - DAY
A wide shot of the empty beach. Small in the frame, the figures of Alice and Lydia walk along the shoreline.
EXT. LIDO BEACH - BOARDWALK
LYDIA
I like that necklace.
ALICE
You haven’t seen it before?
Nope.
LYDIA
ALICE
My Mom gave it to me.
Alice fingers the butterfly pendant as they walk along.
ALICE
When I was a little girl, second
grade, my teacher told me that butterflies don’t live a very long time, they live like a month or something - and I was so upset. And I went home and I told my mother, and she said, yeah but you know, they have a nice life. They have a really beautiful life, so...it makes me think about my mother’s life and my sister’s life. And to a certain extent my own.
LYDIA
You’re going to be around for a long time Mom.
ALICE
Yes yes...There are some things I
want to do. I want to take a sabbatical year with daddy, but I don’t think that’s going to happen. I want to read some classic books I‘ve always meant to read. And I want to see Anna have a baby, I want to see Tom graduate...
LYDIA You will!
PINK PAGES 49
ALICE
And I’d like to see you go to
college. Lydia looks at her.
ALICE
Not for medicine, or anything - but
for drama.
(Lydia shakes her head)
You know, and then if acting doesn’t work out you could teach or you could do workshops. You’d have some kind of backup plan.
LYDIA
Yeah...I don’t want a back-up plan.
I want to do this. I want to give it a shot, it’s not going to happen if I don’t believe in myself.
ALICE
I believe in you, Lydia. I do.
It’s just that, you know, life’s tough. It is tougher than you know. I want you to have some sort of security before I go.
LYDIA
Mom - you have to - you can’t use
your situation to get me to do everything that you want.
ALICE
Why not? Why can’t I?
LYDIA Because it’s not fair.
ALICE
I don’t have to be fair. I’m your
mother. Right... EXT. BEACH -- DAY
Flashbacks of Alice’s memory play like a movie. She is on the beach with her mother and sister.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - DAY
Framed photos show the Howland family at a younger age.
Alice is playing Words With Friends.
PINK PAGES 50
She drags three letters onto the board to make the underwhelming word TONE. As ever, the game is with Anna Howland-Jones.
Alice looks sadly at a photo of Anna, then gazes out of the window into nothingness.
EXT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - UPSTAIRS
John is answering e-mails on his computer as Alice walks up the stairs.
JOHN Hey.
ALICE What’s going on?
JOHN
I’m just working. How about you?
ALICE
Nothing. I need something to read.
JOHN
I thought you were reading Moby
Dick.
ALICE
Yeah. I was. I got tired of
reading the same page over and over again. I can’t focus.
JOHN
That happens to me when I read Moby
Dick too.
(she smiles)
Why don’t you try something lighter.
ALICE
What like the Cat in the Hat?
JOHN
How about some of those plays Lydia
has downstairs? They’re quicker, they’re easy to read. Might give the two of you something to talk about.
Alice nuzzles against him, trying to distract him, but he continues.
ALICE Okay.
PINK PAGES 51
She gets up to head down the stairs.
ALICE
You work all the time.
INT. SECOND BEDROOM
Alice enters. Lydia’s personality can be felt in her absence: incense on the window sill, paintings on the wall, clothes strewn over chair backs.
On the bedside table there’s a pile of plays. Alice picks up a few of the thin volumes and looks at them - Proof, Three Sisters, Angels in America. She opts for Angels in America and is about to set the other two back on the stack when she notices something: a small notebook with the handwritten label “Lydia Howland Journal.”
Alice hesitates a moment, then opens it. EXT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - LIVING AREA - NIGHT
Lydia and Alice are trying to have a productive discussion as per John’s suggestion.
ALICE
What I really liked about it was
how...
She searches for a word.
ALICE
How...big...how wide...the scape of
it was.
LYDIA
Yeah the scope of it.
ALICE
The scope of it, yes that’s the
word. God, listen to me. Lydia perseveres.
LYDIA
It’s unbelievable to me that you
guys had to live through that. You must have known somebody who died from AIDS right?
ALICE
Oh yes, honey. Everybody did. We
lost a lot of people.
PINK PAGES 52
She looks at Lydia.
ALICE
What did you think? You and
Malcolm - you played the Mormons, didn’t you - the husband and wife? You did the scenes in your acting class.
LYDIA
Yeah - how’d you know that?
Alice hesitates.
ALICE
I don’t know. You must have told
me about it.
LYDIA
I didn’t tell you.
ALICE
Well, I don’t know how I know.
Lydia looks right at her.
LYDIA
Mom, did you read my journal?
Alice looks away, trying to remember.
LYDIA
Why? Why would you do that? Mom?!
ALICE
I am so sorry Lydia. I honestly
didn’t understand what I was reading.
LYDIA
You didn’t understand “Lydia
Howland” written across the front of the notebook?
ALICE
I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.
LYDIA
I don’t believe you!
ALICE
I didn’t mean to...
PINK PAGES 53
LYDIA
Okay, it’s fine. I just can’t...
Lydia storms off.
ALICE
Lydia, I didn’t - I really didn’t
know...
LYDIA Just stop!
ALICE
I wouldn’t do that to you.
A door slams. Lydia is gone.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE DINING AREA
In the bright clean light of the day, the table is laden with bagels, lox, toppings, and fruit salad. Anna, Charlie and Tom are visiting. Lydia is conspicuously absent. Alice struggles to follow the conversation.
TOM
So you can’t eat this you know.
ANNA
No, I know. No sushi, no hot dogs -
hot dogs are the worst!
CHARLIE No alcohol.
ANNA No alcohol.
CHARLIE Cigarettes.
ANNA
I’ve never even smoked.
CHARLIE Well I mean...
JOHN
You mean to tell me you’ve never
smoked a cigarette in your entire life?
ANNA Not one.
PINK PAGES 54
CHARLIE
You can’t be too careful.
ANNA
He was so cute. He even grabbed my
hand the other day as I was walking down the stairs.
CHARLIE
I was just trying to protect my investment.
General laughter. Alice jumps in. Rather awkwardly.
ALICE
Anna, I want you to return my Words
with Friends.
ANNA
I’m sorry, Mom. I haven’t had
time.
Lydia walks up to the table.
LYDIA Hey congrats.
ANNA Hey. Thank you.
She hands Lydia a mimosa.
LYDIA
So it’s twins, huh?
ANNA
Yes. A boy and a girl.
TOM Kinda perfect.
JOHN
It’s exactly what your mom and I
were hoping for.
ALICE It’s so wonderful.
John’s phone goes off. He checks the I.D.
JOHN
Oh gosh. I’m sorry. I’ve got to
take this.
PINK PAGES 55
He heads back to the office talking into his cell.
LYDIA
How far along are you?
ANNA
Five weeks. I know it’s very early
days, but...well the timing of things, how we found out, and when we did...well it really worked out in the end.
LYDIA Great. That’s amazing.
Alice smiles, not completely following.
TOM
So Mom, how are you feeling?
ALICE Mostly fine.
TOM Really?
ALICE
Yeah. I use this thing. You know,
instead of a memory. It reminds me to take my medications and things like that.
Alice produces her iPhone.
TOM
It’s nice how technology can help.
Alice starts to open up her iPhone calendar.
ALICE
Lydia, what time is the play?
LYDIA It’s eight o’clock.
CHARLIE
Are you nervous about tomorrow?
LYDIA
Yes. It’ll be find once I’m up
there, but I’ll definitely have to block all of you out.
PINK PAGES 56
ALICE
I’m sorry, what time did you say it was again?
LYDIA Eight o’clock.
Mom, you It’s ok.
No, no. where is
ANNA
don’t have to schedule it.
ALICE
I want to put it in! And it?
LYDIA
The Saugatuck theater.
ALICE Can you spell that?
ANNA
Come on, Mom - it’s not like we’re
going to forget to bring you.
LYDIA

(under her breath)
Oh God.
TOM
Anna, you’re not helping.
ANNA
No, you’re not helping. Why should
she have to worry about remembering something that she doesn’t have to remember?
LYDIA
Well, if you just let her do it she
won’t worry. What’s the problem? Don’t talk about her as if she isn’t sitting right here.
ANNA
I’m not - I’m talking to her.
Aren’t I, Mom?
ALICE Yes. Yes you are.
PINK PAGES 57

ANNA
And what makes you such an expert?
LYDIA Shut up.
ANNA Grow up Lydia!
LYDIA Suck it!
ANNA
Oh, that’s very articulate. Well
said.
ALICE Girls...
LYDIA
You want me to show you?
ANNA
Are you kidding me?
ALICE Girls that’s enough!
LYDIA
Why are you such an asshole?
John re-enters in the middle of the argument.
ALICE Both of you stop it!
JOHN What is going on?
An awkward silence.
CHARLIE
Alice, this is a wonderful spread.
ALICE Thank you, Charlie.
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
With the rest of the family on the balcony, Alice ladles out fruit while Lydia folds napkins.
PINK PAGES 58
ALICE
Lydia. Baby. I have a feeling
that we argued about something yesterday but I can’t remember what it was about.
LYDIA
It was nothing, honestly.
ALICE
No, I know I upset you. I should
apologize.
LYDIA
No. I should apologize. I’m - I
feel really bad. I was so insensitive yesterday. Will you forgive me? Honestly?
ALICE But what for?
Lydia sighs.
LYDIA
It was about you not respecting my
privacy. And I don’t want that, and I take it back - completely. And I’m sorry.
ALICE
I’m sorry. It’s not as if I can
remember it.
LYDIA I know.
Alice laughs. Lydia takes a long look at her Mom.
LYDIA
What is it like? I mean what does
it actually feel like?
ALICE
Well, it’s not always the same. I
have good days and bad days. On my good days, I can almost pass for a normal person. But on my bad days, I feel like I can’t find myself.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 59
ALICE (cont'd)
I’ve always been so defined by my intellect, my language, my articulation, and now sometimes I can see the words hanging in front of me and I can’t reach them and I don’t know who I am and I don’t know what I’m going to lose next.
LYDIA
It sounds horrible.
They pick up some bowls and head outside.
ALICE Thanks for asking.
INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alice finishes cleaning her teeth. As John enters the bathroom, she comes into the bedroom, ready for sleep.
She is about to climb into bed, when she notices something. Under the covers is an old-fashioned school notebook, with the label Lydia Howland Journal. There’s a yellow post-it on it that says “No Secrets.” Alice is deeply moved.
ALICE Oh, Lydia...
INT. SAUGATUCK STREET THEATRE
In small community theater, Lydia is on stage, playing Irina in Chekhov’s THREE SISTERS. All three sisters are on stage. MASHA speaks. The family watches Lydia.
MASHA
They are leaving us. One has quite
left us, quite and for ever. We remain alone, to begin our life over again. We must live... we must live....
LYDIA/IRINA There will come a time when
everybody will know why, for what purpose, there is all this suffering, and there will be no more mysteries. But now we must live...
IN THE AUDIENCE
Watching Lydia perform, Alice is calmly attentive.
PINK PAGES 60
BACK ON STAGE
LYDIA/IRINA
...we must work, just work! To- morrow, I'll go away alone, and I'll teach and give my whole life to those who may perhaps, need it. It's autumn now, soon it will be winter, the snow will cover everything, and I shall be working, just working....
IN THE AUDIENCE
Abruptly, there’s resounding APPLAUSE.
John stands, smiling, clapping. Alice follows suit.
ON STAGE
Lydia and the rest of the cast take their bows.
INT. BACKSTAGE - CORRIDOR
We follow Alice from behind, as she walks backstage following her family. The corridor is crowded with FRIENDS OF THE CAST.
INT. BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOMS
The family greets Lydia, who’s just emerged from the dressing room. There’s a cacophony of voices, as Charlie, Tom, John, and Anna all chime in on Lydia’s performance.
ANNA
There she is! Hey, you were
amazing.
JOHN
Miss Howland, would you sign this
for me?
When Alice arrives, Lydia comes into focus. Alice chooses her words carefully.
ALICE
It was just wonderful. I found it
so easy to empathize with her. You really caught her despair, but also her joy.
This pleases Lydia enormously.
LYDIA Thank you. Awesome.
PINK PAGES 61
ALICE
So will we get to see you in
anything else this summer?
Lydia’s looks at her nervously, her eyes scanning her mother’s face, but she keeps her emotion in check.
LYDIA
No, this is the only job I got.
ALICE
Oh so you’re here just for the
season?
LYDIA Yeah -
Tears well in Lydia’s eyes - but she does not have the heart to contradict Alice’s misunderstanding.
ANNA
Mom! Mom, this is Lydia. Your
daughter.
ALICE ...I know that.
John looks on worried. Lydia tries to keep the conversation going.
LYDIA
Thanks for coming, to see me.
This is so weird, it’s like embarrassing.
ALICE
Don’t be embarrassed. Please,
don’t be.
INT. DR. BENJAMIN’S OFFICE - DAY
We see Alice gradually coming into focus.
ALICE Giraffe...Hammer...Comb.
Oh I know what that is. It’s like a chicken. But it’s not..
The card shows a duck.
ALICE It’s...it’s a duck!
PINK PAGES 62
DR. BENJAMIN How about this one?
ALICE Basketball.
He puts the cards down.
DR. BENJAMIN
Can you spell water backwards for
me?
ALICE
Well, let me try it forwards first.
She holds her fingers up one by one. John looks very uncomfortable.
ALICE
W...A...T...E...R. So backwards...
(folding down her fingers) R...E...T...
(she hesitates) A...W!
DR. BENJAMIN
Very good.
Alice nods - pleased to have completed the task.
DR. BENJAMIN
Now do you remember the name I gave
you a few minutes ago?
ALICE
I feel as though you always tell me
and I never remember it.
DR. BENJAMIN
Was it John Black, John White, John
Jones, or John Smith? She guesses randomly.
ALICE Smith.
DR. BENJAMIN
And his address, was it East
Street, Washington Street, Main Street or Humbolt Street?
John speaks up.
PINK PAGES 63
JOHN
Sorry to jump in here, we’re both
concerned about the rate of deterioration. Is that normal?
DR. BENJAMIN
Every case is different. With
Familial Early Onset, things can go fast -- and actually with people who have a high level of education, it can go faster. Often they’ve managed to sustain their mental processes by innovative means and that delays diagnosis. Clearly Alice’s memory is failing but she’s still incredibly resourceful.
ALICE Thank you.
DR. BENJAMIN
I know you’re discouraged. But
sometimes I’ve seen patients plateau, even at this point. Don’t lose hope. Alice, I read your name in the Dementia Care Conference brochure. You’re going to give a speech.
Alice nods.
ALICE Will you be there?
DR. BENJAMIN
Yes, I’m looking forward to it.
JOHN
I’m going to be away on business in
Minnesota and I’m worried. Are you sure this is a good idea -- considering the state that she’s in? She’s going to be under a lot of stress.
DR. BENJAMIN
Oh, I think it will be great for
her. I’m sure everything will be fine. You’re not worried are you, Alice?
She ponders this for a moment.
PINK PAGES 64
ALICE
No, I don’t think so.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - OFFICE - DAYS LATER
Alice is practicing her speech out loud, going over the words with a yellow marker. On the computer in front of her, Lydia is on Skype.
ALICE
“Various ways to prevent the
production of Amyloid are being tried. There is a new study that combines base and gamma secretase inhibitors and this is one of our best hopes for the future...” That’s it. That’s the speech.
LYDIA
It’s good, Mom. It’s good. It’s
very scientific.
ALICE
Yes. Well, you know.
LYDIA
And I’m sure it’s valid. But um...
ALICE But what?
LYDIA
I mean, is there any value in
making it a bit more personal?
ALICE
I don’t understand. What do you
mean by personal?
LYDIA
It’s not a speech to a room of
scientists. What I want to know really is how you feel. What does it feel like? What does this disease mean to you?
ALICE (getting irritable)
You weren’t listening because that’s all there. That’s in the speech.
LYDIA
Okay. Don’t ask me then.
PINK PAGES 65
ALICE
Oh no then, I won’t ask - then.
Lydia gives it a moment then tries to re-engage her mother.
LYDIA
Hey...mom...let’s give it one more
shot, okay?
ALICE (annoyed)
I can’t because I have done it already. I use this - this yellow thingy - to make it so I don’t have to read the same line over and over and over again.
Alice waves her highlighter pen at the screen.
LYDIA
Got it. Totally. Just print out
one more.
ALICE
Do you know that it took me three
days to write this?
LYDIA
You can print out one more...
ALICE
No no! It took me three days!
LYDIA Sorry.
ALICE Three days.
She clicks off the Skype and stares at the blank screen.
INT. LECTURE THEATER - AFTERNOON
From behind, we follow Alice and Tom as they enter a large, crowded lecture hall, led by LUCIA GUZMAN, a coordinator for the Alzheimer’s Association.
LUCIA GUZMAN
Here you are...
ALICE Thank you.
PINK PAGES 66
She removes two ‘RESERVED’ stickers on places at the front of the auditorium. Alice sits, a sheaf of papers in her lap. Tom cranes around to look at a sea of unknown faces.
Alice sees Anna and Charlie about eight rows behind and waves. A voice comes in from the left.
DR. BENJAMIN Hello there.
TOM Hello.
Alice turns and sees Dr. Benjamin - recognizes him, but can’t remember his name.
ALICE
Oh, Hi. Tom this is my doctor.
This is my son.
DR. BENJAMIN
I’m Travis Benjamin, I’m your
mother’s neurologist.
ALICE This is my son, Tom.
DR. BENJAMIN So how you feeling Alice?
ALICE
I think I’m nervous.
DR. BENJAMIN
You’re going to do great. Break a
leg!
He smiles encouragingly as he departs.
DR. BENJAMIN (to Tom)
Nice to meet you.
INT. LECTURE THEATER -ON STAGE AFTERNOON Lucia Guzman is now at the podium.
LUCIA GUZMAN
It’s a great honor to welcome our next speaker, Alice Howland. A former Professor of Linguistics at Columbia, she’s written textbooks and she’s lectured all over the world.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 67
LUCIA GUZMAN (cont'd)
Alice has been living with Early Onset Alzheimer’s with the care and support of her loving family. Please welcome Alice Howland.
Alice walks to the podium, sets down her file and looks out to the sea of strange, intimidating faces.
ALICE
Hello. Please give me a minute
here.
She uncaps her pen. And she begins reading from her speech, highlighting each sentence as she goes. It makes for an awkward presentation.
ALICE
Good morning. It’s an honor to be
here. The poet Elizabeth Bishop once wrote: 'the Art of Losing isn't hard to master: so many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster.' I'm not a poet, I am a person living with Early Onset Alzheimer’s, and as that person I find myself learning the art of losing every day.
She turns the page and looks up.
ALICE
Losing my bearings, losing objects,
losing sleep, but mostly losing memories...
When she looks back down, she knocks the pages from the podium. A murmur from the assembled. Alice tries to gather up the pages with the help of Lucia Guzman. For a long moment, she seems lost in confusion. Finally, she finds a page with some yellow markings on it and resumes.
ALICE
I think I’ll try to forget that
just happened.
Warm laughter from the crowd - they’re with her!
ALICE
All my life I’ve accumulated
memories - they’ve become, in a way, my most precious possessions.
(MORE)
PINK PAGES 68
ALICE (cont'd)
The night I first met my husband, the first time I held my textbook in my hands. Having children, making friends, traveling the world. Everything I accumulated in life, everything I’ve worked so hard for - now all that is being ripped away. As you can imagine, or as you know, this is hell. But it gets worse.
In the audience, Dr. Benjamin is willing her on.
ALICE
For who can take us seriously when
we are so far from who we once were? Our strange behavior and fumbled sentences change other’s perception of us and our perception of ourselves. We become ridiculous, incapable, comic. But this is not us, this is our disease. And like any disease it has a cause, it has a progression, and it could have a cure. My greatest wish is that my children, our children - the next generation - do not have to face what I am facing.
Anna watches her mother from the audience, the words resonating.
ALICE
But for the time being, I’m still
alive. I know I’m alive. I still have people I love dearly. I still have things I want to do with my life. I rail against myself for not being able to remember things - but I still have small moments in the day of pure happiness and joy.
She turns the final page. Tom has tears in his eyes.
ALICE
So, 'live in the moment' I tell myself. It's really all I can do, live in the moment. And not beat myself up too much for mastering the art of losing. One thing I will try to hold onto though is the memory of speaking here today. It will go, I know it will.
PINK PAGES 69
 (MORE)
ALICE (cont'd)
It may be gone by tomorrow. But it means so much to be talking here, like my old ambitious self who was so fascinated by communication. Thank you for this opportunity. It means the world to me.
Alice looks up from her pages.
ALICE Thank you.
The audience breaks into applause. Strong applause that builds and builds. Spontaneously, people rise from their chairs and give her a standing ovation.
EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK
A cold and rainy day. Winter is approaching.
INT. ALICE'S HOME - BEDROOM -- MORNING
John is dressing for work, in mid-explanation. Alice is sitting on the bed in a crumpled shirt.
JOHN
It’s the Mayo Clinic. It would start up next spring and I would be heading my own team.
ALICE
So you want to move to...
JOHN
Minnesota. Rochester, Minnesota.
It could be a whole new adventure for us. You might even like it there.
ALICE
Everything I know is here. Anna
and Tom and the babies that are coming.
JOHN
It’s a two hour flight. We’d see
them almost as much as we do now. Ali, this just came up and they haven’t even made a formal offer. But don’t you see? This is it - they’re working on so many cutting edge treatments, they’ve got so many resources-
PINK PAGES 70
Alice, visibly distressed, tries to think this through.
ALICE
I understand. I understand that
work is important. I miss working. I think you should ask them if you can start in a year.
JOHN
It’s not academia, Ali. They don’t
give sabbaticals.
ALICE
But to pick up and move, at this
point, when I...when we...
(shakes her head, frustrated)
Why can’t I say what I want to say?
JOHN
Ali, one way or another, we’ll
still be together.
ALICE So no time off.
JOHN
(getting frustrated)
I just can’t take a year off. Financially - it’s not an option. God knows what we’ll be facing further down the line.
ALICE
That’s it then, that’s it.
JOHN What?
ALICE
You - you don’t want that. A year
at home, with me, watching this. You don’t want it.
JOHN
I didn’t say that.
ALICE You didn’t have to.
She turns and looks right at him. He looks away.
PINK PAGES 71
INT. ALICE'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Alice is doing her daily questions.
ON A WHITE SCREEN
WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR OLDEST DAUGHTER?
The answer comes in A - N - N - E
Then corrects: A - N - N - A
WHAT MONTH WERE YOU BORN IN?
The predictive text has a hard time figuring out “October.”
INT. ALICE’S HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alice lies awake in bed. She checks the alarm clock - 2.05. After a moment, she sighs and gets out of bed.
INT. HALLWAY
Tentatively she descends the stairs in the dark.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - KITCHEN
Entering the kitchen, she finds her bag on the counter and begins to empty out the contents: keys, wallet, tissues.
She looks in a second bag -- magazines, papers.
She opens the kitchen drawer. It contains a wide assortment of items - screwdrivers, packets of seeds, a tape measure, Scotch tape, drink coasters, a potato.
ALICE
Where the hell is it?!
In frustration, she picks up the fish bowl full of keys and loose change and unceremoniously dumps it out. It makes an explosive sound as the contents scatter across the granite counter top. Manically, she begins sorting through everything.
John enters.
JOHN
Ali, what are you doing?
ALICE I can’t find it!
PINK PAGES 72
JOHN Can’t find what?
ALICE
I’m looking for my phone.
JOHN
It’s the middle of the night.
ALICE
It goes off at 8 o’clock every
morning and asks me these questions. I have to find it.
JOHN
We’ll look for it in the morning.
ALICE
No, I have to find it.
JOHN
I’ll help you find it tomorrow.
ALICE No...No.
JOHN
Tomorrow. I’ll help you find it.
ALICE
Help - help me find it.
JOHN
I promise we’ll find it. Come to
bed with me. Come to bed with me please...please.
ALICE Okay...
Her manic rage finally subsides.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - KITCHEN - MIDDAY
From the front room, there are sounds of John on the phone. At the kitchen table, Alice, in a quiet mood, is doing a jigsaw puzzle.
Someone approaches from the dining room, carrying take-out.
Hi.
ANNA
PINK PAGES 73
ALICE Anne? Hi.
ANNA
Hi Mom. It’s Ann-a.
She kisses Alice on the cheek.
ALICE
I thought you were my sister.
ANNA
ALICE
How are you feeling?
ANNA
So uncomfortable. I can’t breathe.
I can’t sleep. Was it like this for you?
ALICE
I didn’t have two at a time.
ANNA This is true.
Anna unloads the Thai food on the counter. John enters.
JOHN
Did you get the green curry?
ANNA
I did. It’s right here.
Everything on track?
JOHN
Yeah. They’ve made a very generous
offer.
ANNA Oh, that’s great.
JOHN I guess.
John sighs, conflicted.
ANNA
No it is. It’s absolutely the
right decision.
It’s ok.
PINK PAGES 74
JOHN
Would you like some water?
ANNA Yes, please.
John starts getting some glasses out for drinks.
ALICE
John, what happened? Who was that
on the phone?
JOHN
That was that hospital honey, the
Mayo Clinic
ALICE
Oh. Is someone sick?
JOHN
No. Nothing’s wrong. Everything
is absolutely fine.
He moves to the freezer, opens it and picks out an ice tray.
JOHN Oh My God.
Reaching into the back of the freezer, he produces a frozen, frost-encrusted iPhone. He shows it to Alice.
ALICE Oh no.
(she approaches)
I was looking for it all last night.
She takes the phone and examines it.
JOHN
(quietly, to Anna)
That was over a month ago.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING
Alice is slowly, painfully, trying to tie her shoe-laces.

Young Alice is given a piggy back ride by her dad by the shoreline. She rushes suddenly towards the camera.

Slowly, Alice gets up out of bed. John begins laying out clothes for her - more like her original style.
JOHN
I’ve got some very good news for
you. Let me help you get your pants on.
ALICE
I want my green one.
JOHN
Oh, I think this one would be
really really nice. Let’s put that one on. Lean on me. Okay hold on.
Tenderly, he helps her get dressed.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Led by John, Alice walks along brightly lit corridors, passing DOCTORS, NURSES, PATIENTS. They approach Anna’s room.
ALICE (whispering)
What’s wrong with her? She looks terrible.
PINK PAGES 76
JOHN
She’s just delivered the babies,
honey! INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
They walk through a door. Anna is in the bed cradling a baby. Charlie is by her side with another.
ALICE
Anna! You had your babies!
ANNA I did mom!
Charlie unfolds the blanket, revealing a small pink face.
CHARLIE This is Allison.
JOHN
You look so beautiful.
ANNA Thank you.
CHARLIE
And that’s Charlie Jr.
JOHN My goodness.
Allison starts crying.
ALICE Can I hold her?
CHARLIE
Um -- is that a good idea?
ALICE
I know how to hold a baby.
ANNA
That’s okay, Mom. You can sit right
there in that chair.
Alice sits on a chair and Charlie hands her the baby.
ANNA That’s good.
PINK PAGES 77
CHARLIE
Something tells me you’ve done this
before.
Alice looks down happily at the baby, then over to Anna.
ALICE She looks like you.
Something breaks in Anna -- she beams back at her mother. Alice continues to look at the baby with pure unalloyed joy.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Alice is asleep on the sofa. Out of focus in the distance, her family talks about her future.
JOHN
There are days she knows where she
is, certainly, but just as many days when she doesn’t. Maybe she thinks she’s a child back in New Hampshire, or who knows where...
ANNA
It’s happening more and more, Tom.
She doesn’t know what’s going on.
TOM
Yeah, but...I always think of what
she said in the speech, y’know, how important her memories are to who she is...
ANNA
I know but, but that was months
ago.
JOHN
Guys, this is difficult for all of
us. But what we have to remember is who Alice was. She would not want to be a burden. Anna, you have the babies, and you want to go back to work. And you’re not in a position to care for her, not seriously, Tom. And I can’t keep Mayo waiting. Beginning of the month, I’m gone.
Alice starts to wake up.
PINK PAGES 78
JOHN
Now I want to take her with me. And once she adjusts to Minnesota, she’ll be happier for it and so will we all.
A thoughtful moment.
TOM
Lydia’s gonna flip out.
ANNA So let her.
TOM Well, she is.
ANNA
She has no right to. If she really
cared, she wouldn’t be on the other side of the country.
Suddenly, they become aware of Alice sitting up, listening.
ALICE It’s hot in here.
There’s a moment’s self-consciousness at the table: how much did she overhear?
INT. ALICE’S HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING
Alice is talking to Lydia on Skype. A kettle is close to boiling on a stove in the background.
ALICE
So who is he exactly?
LYDIA
A manager. His name’s Bill
Thompson.
ALICE
And why is he so important?
LYDIA
He’ll open doors, get me to
auditions I wouldn’t have access to. He got me some good headshots.
ALICE
I see. What’s his name?
PINK PAGES 79
LYDIA
Bill Thompson. He’s with Thompson
and Gould if you want to look them up. They’re good.
ALICE
The kettle’s boiling.
LYDIA Where’s Elena?
Alice goes over to the stove, puts a tea bag in the cup and pours water over it.
ALICE
I’m making myself a cup of tea.
LYDIA Cool...where’s your caretaker?
ALICE
Elena is not here today. Her
daughter is sick. She’s at the doctor.
LYDIA
So you’re there alone?
ALICE
I can make myself a cup of tea.
She returns to the computer.
LYDIA
Okay. You want to check out my
headshot? If I send you a link can you open the file - download the file?
Yes!
ALICE
LYDIA Good.

There you go. I’ll talk to you later, okay. I love you.
Bye.
Bye.
ALICE
LYDIA
PINK PAGES 80
Alice clicks on the file from Lydia to download it.
When the download is complete, she clicks Skype closed but cannot find the file. She clicks one folder on her desktop, then another, then another.
One of the folders opens revealing a Quicktime with a picture of herself on it.
Surprised, she clicks on it. It is the Butterfly file. There on the screen is Alice - younger, sharper, coherent, reassuring.
ALICE ON QUICKTIME Hi Alice. I’m you and I have
something very important to say to you. I guess you’ve come to that point, the point where you can’t answer the questions. And this is the logical next step. It’s the right step, I’m sure of that.
Present-day Alice watches, intrigued, amused, not reckoning with the seriousness of what her old self has to say.
ALICE ON QUICKTIME Because what’s happening to you,
the Alzheimer’s - you could see it as tragic. But your life has been anything but tragic. You’ve had a remarkable career, you’ve had a great marriage, and three beautiful children.
Alice on Quicktime has to struggle to control her emotions. Present-day Alice just sits there watching like a curious bird.
ALICE ON QUICKTIME All right. Listen to me, Alice.
This is important. Make sure you are alone. Go to your bedroom. There’s a dresser by the window, the one with the blue lamp on it. Go to the dresser and open the drawer. In the back of the drawer are some pills. It says ‘take all pills with water’ on it. There are a lot of pills in that bottle, but you need to swallow them all.
Present-day Alice is now listening attentively.
PINK PAGES 81
ALICE ON QUICKTIME
Then go to the bed, lie down and go
to sleep. And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing, okay?
Abruptly, the Quicktime ends. Alice obediently gets up and leaves the room.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - STAIRCASE
Alice climbs the stairs, muttering to herself.
ALICE
Dressing table, blue lamp.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - MASTER BEDROOM Alice enters, still muttering.
ALICE
Dressing table, blue lamp. Dressing table, blue lamp.
She stands in the center of the room, looking around, confused. She goes to the dressing table...There’s a blue lamp on it...But she doesn’t know what to do next.
INT. ALICE’S HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING ANGLE ON THE COMPUTER
ALICE ON QUICKTIME ...Go to your bedroom. There’s
that dressing table, the one with the blue lamp on it. Go to that table and open the drawer. In the back of the drawer are some pills. It says ‘take all pills with water’ on it.
Present-day Alice, listens, again trying to memorize the instructions.
INT. STAIRCASE
We follow Alice from behind as she heads back up the stairs. INT. MASTER BEDROOM
She enters again, heads over to the dressing table.
ALICE
Dressing table, blue lamp. Dressing table, blue lamp.
PINK PAGES 82
She pulls the drawer out. There are bits of old jewelry and accessories, some coins. Alice picks out a bracelet made of polished grey stones, puts it on and inspects it. She realizes she’s forgotten something -- but what was it?
INT. STAIRCASE
Now Alice heads back up the stairs carrying the laptop as the message plays:
ALICE ON QUICKTIME ...Go to your bedroom. There’s a
dresser by the window, the one with the blue lamp on it. Go to the dresser and open the drawer. In the back of the drawer are some pills.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM
She enters and sees the drawer already open. She wanders up to it and looks down. This time she seizes immediately on the pill bottle and holds it up. We see the attached note in Macro close up - TAKE ALL PILLS WITH WATER.
ALICE ON QUICKTIME
It says ‘take all pills with water’ on it. There are a lot of pills in that bottle, but you need to swallow them all. Then get into bed and go to sleep. Then go to the bed, lie down and go to sleep. And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing, okay?
INT. BATHROOM
She enters the bathroom. Going over to the basin, she empties out the contents of the toothbrush mug into the sink. She fills the mug with water and empties the pill bottle into her hand. Then -- A NOISE!
Hello?
ELENA (O.S.)
Alice turns her head and, in shock, drops the pills. They scatter everywhere.
INT. HALLWAY
Elena enters downstairs and closes the door.
PINK PAGES 83

Alice stares down at the pills blankly not knowing what to do next.

Alice and John are at the head of the line, looking at the array behind the counter.
JOHN

chocolate hazelnut. Alice, you know what you want right?
ALICE
Cookies and cream and a chocolate
hazelnut.
JOHN
No honey. You usually have the original with blueberries and coconut.
ALICE Ok...
JOHN
Original with blueberries and
coconut please.
MOMENTS LATER
John and Alice are eating their frozen yoghurt.
JOHN
Ali, you see that building over
there? Do you know what it is? He points to a structure in the distance.
ALICE
I don’t think I know that.
JOHN
That’s Columbia. Where you used to
teach.
ALICE
Someone told me, I was a good
teacher.
JOHN Yes, you were.
PINK PAGES 84
ALICE
I was really smart.
John looks away, fighting back emotion that threatens to overwhelm him.
JOHN
You were the smartest person I’ve
ever known.
He looks at her, struggling with something.
JOHN
Alice. Do you still want to be
here?
She answers brightly.
ALICE
I’m not done yet. Do we have to
go?
JOHN
No. Don’t worry. Take your time.
EXT. ALICE’S HOME - DAY
Blossoms in a tree show signs of another spring. A taxi pulls up outside.
INT. HALLWAY
Alice sleeps on the sofa in the front room. John carries a suitcase into the hallway. Behind him is Lydia.
JOHN (O.S.)
Is this all of your stuff?
LYDIA
I shipped some boxes as well.
JOHN
Were you sad to leave L.A.?
LYDIA
I’m trying to convince myself I’m
more of an east coast girl. Where’s mom?
JOHN She’s sleeping.
He indicates the sleeping Alice.

INT. ALICE’S OFFICE
The room has been partially converted back to bedroom, but some of Alice’s touches remain.
JOHN
Yeah well - here it is. Your old
room.
They drop the bags.
JOHN
How did it go with your manager...?
LYDIA
It’s a west coast company, so...you
know. Not good.
JOHN
Oh. That’s too bad. You sure you
don’t mind..?
LYDIA
Dad, we’ve had that conversation.
JOHN Okay.
LYDIA
This is New York. I’ll audition.
Do theater. I know this is where I need to be so...
John nods, weighing his daughter’s sacrifice.
JOHN
Well...you’re a better man than I
being a
am.
She looks at him. Troubled, he looks quickly away.
LYDIA Dad...I got her, okay.
Unexpectedly, the dam bursts. He starts sobbing uncontrollably. She pulls him into a hug.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY
We see the seasons pass -- spring, summer, fall...
PINK PAGES 86
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY
It’s a bleak winter’s day in a small unfriendly park overlooking the cold Hudson river and the distant grey shores of New Jersey.
A few PEOPLE are scattered through the park -- walking dogs or jogging by.
A TEENAGE BOY strums a melancholy tune on his guitar and harmonizes with his GIRLFRIEND.
On a bench nearby, Lydia is checking her phone. Next to her sits Alice, visibly diminished. She picks repeatedly at her coat.
LYDIA
It’s getting pretty cold, huh. You
want to head home? Come on. Let’s do it.
helps Alice up and they shuffle off down the path.
ALICE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM
Hey.
ELENA
Hi. How was your walk?
ALICE
I don’t think I know you!
ELENA Yes, you do.
LYDIA Mom, it’s Elena.
Alice responds with a vague, unfocused look. It’s not clear she even recognizes her.
LYDIA
I’m going to get you some juice,
okay.
ELENA
Come on, let’s take off your coat
and go inside.
Lydia

Alice
the nurses aide, ELENA.

INT. HOWLAND HOUSE - FRONT ROOM
Alice has a cup of juice and is staring into space. Lydia sits in front of her, book in hand, reading a speech from Angels in America.
LYDIA (O.S.)
Night flight to San Francisco;
chase the moon across America. God, it’s been years since I was on a plane. When we hit 35,000 feet we’ll have reached the tropopause, the great belt of calm air - as close as I’ll get to the ozone. I dreamed we were there.
Lydia looks directly at her Mom, but Alice seems absent.
LYDIA
The plane leapt the tropopause, the
safe air, and attained the outer rim, the ozone, which was ragged and torn, patches of it threadbare as old cheesecloth, and that was frightening. But I saw something only I could see because of my astonishing ability to see such things.
Then -- a flicker of comprehension. Alice’s eyes turn to Lydia as she reads.
LYDIA
Souls were rising, from the earth
far below, souls of the dead, of people who’d perished from famine, from war, from the plague, and they floated up like skydivers in reverse, limbs all akimbo, wheeling and spinning.
Lydia notices her mother’s attention and it inspires her reading.
LYDIA
And the souls of these departed,
joined hands, clasped ankles and formed a web - a great net of souls. And the souls were three- atom oxygen molecules of the stuff of ozone, and the outer rim absorbed them, and was repaired. Nothing’s lost forever.

LYDIA (cont'd)
In this world, there is a kind of painful progress, a longing for what we’ve left behind, and dreaming ahead. At least I think that’s so.
Alice looks down. Lydia breaks from her performance.
LYDIA That’s it.
She comes over to Alice, sits down next to her.
LYDIA
Hey...did you like that? What I
just read, did you like it?
Alice nods. It’s unclear she even knows what Lydia is talking about. But Lydia persists, wanting some kind of affirmation.
LYDIA
What was it about?
ALICE
Love. Love.
Tears come into Lydia’s eyes.
LYDIA
Yeah, Mom. It was about love.
Alice smiles and looks at Lydia. She is still able to connect.
There is a SUPER 8 FLICKER, a memory, of Alice and her sister walking away from the camera on a beach long ago.
