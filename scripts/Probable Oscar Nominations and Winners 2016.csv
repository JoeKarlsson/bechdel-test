July: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is hot off awards season with a triple win for Writing, Directing, and Picture for Birdman. Combine that with the fact that he's back together with Emmanuel Lubezki, who's cinematography also got an Oscar for Birdman, and you have a duo that is sure to at least be mentioned once awards season is in full swing. There's also been some talk of Lubezki and Inarritu's decision to only feature on location shots with natural lighting, which  shows that some real effort towards the quality of this film is being made. The film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, who has social media's side concerning Oscars, and Tom Hardy in a villainous role which could make an excellent Supporting Actor possibility.","The Revenant","Feature Film","Alejandro González Iñárritu","","","151","2015","adventure, drama, western","","2015-12-25","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663202/"

July: Stephen Spielberg. The Coen brothers. Tom Hanks. Janusz Kaminski. No John Williams, but when it's a trade for Thomas Newman, you're just as safe. Michael Kahn. Adam Stockhausen, the production designer for last year's winner The Grand Budapest Hotel. This is a team that could only be better lined up for Oscars if Meryl Streep and Rick Baker were also present. This is also a story that follows a lawyer working with the CIA during the Cold War, which would be a juicier plotline if this was the early 2000s, but still makes for a great piece of Oscar bait. If we aren't still talking about this in January, I will be thoroughly shocked.","Bridge of Spies","Feature Film","Steven Spielberg","","8.1","141","2015","biography, drama, history, thriller","17962","2015-10-04","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3682448/"

July: Right here, right now, one of the five slots for Original Screenplay is taken. Tarantino is one of the greatest screenwriters of all time, and with this movie he's going to the era he's proved to be his favorite. Solid cast involved, though know real standouts as potential nominees, but we'll see if Samuel L. Jackson or someone else can turn something on. Robert Richardson taking the duty of DP also makes this a solid bet for Cinematography, so watch out for that too. We'll see if this can be as big as Django Unchained. Or bigger.","The Hateful Eight","Feature Film","Quentin Tarantino","","","182","2015","western","","2015-12-25","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/"

July: As much as I disliked American Heist, David O. Russel's last project was a big Oscar hit, along with his previous film Silver Linings Playbook (which, by the way, I loved.) Jennifer Lawrence is back with him again, along with Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro. De Niro should have a substantial part, though the size of Cooper's role is still up in the air. This could be one of Lawrence juiciest roles for Oscar yet, so look for a really solid campaign for her this year.","Joy","Feature Film","David O.

July: Just about every year, Oscar has a ""little"" film that makes it out with all the big guys. Last year we had Whiplash, which was an extraordinary example as it went to win three Oscars. This year we have Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. Not a ton of categories it can make it in, but don't count it out of the race. This was an absolutely excellent film with the perfect Indie feel, and that could keep it in for the long haul.","Me and Earl and the Dying Girl","Feature Film","Alfonso Gomez-Rejon","9","7.9","105","2015","comedy, drama","37679","2015-01-25","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582496/"

July: Ridley Scott has yet to make a comeback since his last film which was even liked, way back in 2012, much less crack into the awards race, back in 2007. This is a fascinating story he has to work with, and one of the most prospectively deep casts of the year. Look for tech categories, but as for anything else, we'll have to see if this movie is any good or not. If it is good, then there's a lot of room for nominations.","The Martian","Feature Film","Ridley Scott","","8.2","144","2015","adventure, drama, sci_fi","168544","2015-09-11","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/"

July: Robert Zemeckis is an outstanding director of the 80s and 90s. Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, and Cast Away are all timeless films that are so because they're really good, well loved movies. The 20th century hasn't been quite so nice for Zemeckis, with Flight being the only movie to even garner a nomination. Here though, Zemeckis looks to have his best shot yet. A fascinating true story, sure to be full of suspense and intense drama. He's got Joseph Gordon-Levitt starring in a juicy role and his old Alan Silvestri composing, which sets the bar pretty nicely as we look at this first trailer.","The Walk","Feature Film","Robert Zemeckis","","7.7","123","2015","adventure, biography, drama, thriller","19407","2015-09-26","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3488710/"

July: Ditto to everything said about The Walk. Only differences are that I see Shailene Woodley having a bit more potential in the Supporting Actress category. I also see a fair possibility that this story is going to be too fresh in people's minds, particularly when Citizen Four went home with the Best Documentary award not even a year ago. However, if the movie is truly a good one, what it's about and when it's made doesn't make a difference. That's why the Oscars are so wonderful.","Snowden","Feature Film","Oliver Stone","","","","2016","biography, drama, thriller","","2016-05-04","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3774114/"

July: Rush was a huge disappointment when the Oscar nominations rolled around two years ago, but somehow I have a feeling this isn't going to be the same story. Ron Howard is an Academy favorite, and though he hasn't had any luck since Frost Nixon, this could very well be a bounceback film. I might count this is right now for Adapted Screenplay, with one of the most interesting concepts of any film this year. As for acting, we'll see whether Whishaw or Hemsworth are billed as Leading or Supporting, though I'm unsure whether or not either actor can pull it off. With the proper direction from Howard though, that could all change.","In the Heart of the Sea","Feature Film","Ron Howard","","","121","2015","action, adventure, drama, history","","2015-12-03","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1390411/"

July: This could be one of the strongest Best Actor contenders of the year. An incredibly juicy role, and Ian McKellan is at his prime to play the awards season to his advantage. Whether or not the film can hold up on its own is another question though. Bill Condon has had a very hit-or-miss career, but his biggest hit had McKellan as his lead, so this could be a nice result. Watch for Production and Costume design as well, with a period piece like this one.","Mr. Holmes","Feature Film","Bill Condon","","7.0","104","2015","drama, mystery","21143","2015-02-08","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3168230/"

July: Definitely a lock for Best Animated Film, and a safe early bet for the winner of that category, so the real question comes as to whether or not Inside Out can be the fourth animated film ever to land a Best Picture nomination. It is after all directed by Pete Doctor, the director of Up, which is one of the prestigious three. AMPAS did elect to keep up to ten nominees, which certainly helps its chances, and the level at which this film was received certainly gives it a boost. If it does make it that far, I want to see if Doctor is able to land a nomination for Directing. The brilliance of his conception, creation, and execution is certainly worthy and successful, but the fact that this is an animated film is going to put a damper on everything.","Inside Out","Feature Film","Pete Docter, Ronnie Del Carmen","9","8.4","94","2015","animation, adventure, comedy, drama, family, fantasy","190175","2015-05-18","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/"

July: An extremely early bet would place Cate Blanchett going head-to-head with Jennifer Lawrence for the Best Actress win, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. This could be a very juicy, Blue Jasmine type role for Blanchett, though the pen of Woody Allen certainly helps any performance. Also look for a strong Supporting Actress run from Rooney Mara who tied for the Best Actress award at the Cannes film festival. Whether or not Carol will play for other awards is still up in the air, but we can certainly count on these.","Carol","Feature Film","Todd Haynes","","7.3","118","2015","drama, romance","2244","2015-05-17","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402927/"

July: Similar to Carol, the only guarantee we have about Youth right now is that it's going to be a player in the acting categories. With Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, and Jane Fonda all taking major roles we could potentially see three or four acting nominations for Youth in the end. Unlike Carol though, I'm a little more confident in this film's ability to play in other categories as well. It has already been in contention for the Palm d'Or at Cannes, and though it fell short, Paolo Sorrento (the Foreign Language Film winner from two years ago) could have a big breakthrough with this drama","Youth","Feature Film","Paolo Sorrentino","","7.5","118","2015","drama","11082","2015-05-20","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3312830/"

July: Antoine Fuqua has had a fairly unpopular career in awards terms, yet has concreted himself in this generation as a quality filmmaker. Training Day was his closest attempt, nabbing a couple nominations for the film, but none for himself. If the film is good enough, which we'll find out in just a couple weeks, Southpaw could change all of that. Jake Gyllenhaal is hot on the Oscar trail, and has been for a couple years now giving out quality performances but coming up short on nominations, as seen with both Prisoners and Nightcrawler. I believe his performance alone is what brought Nightcrawler into Oscar conversation last year, which ultimately ended up with it receiving an Original Screenplay nomination. I don't doubt Gyllenhaal's performance to be good enough for Oscar, but if the film is sub-par, it's hard to stand out.","Southpaw","Feature Film","Antoine Fuqua","","7.5","124","2015","action, drama, sport, thriller","93554","2015-06-15","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798684/"

July: Right now, I don't see this movie doing any more than Actress, Screenplay, and Song, none of which are guaranteed, but there is always room for more if the film is deserving. With Cody penning the screenplay and Streep starring, Ricki is placed into Oscar conversation, which is the first step, but I'm still very skeptical.","Ricki and the Flash","Feature Film","Jonathan Demme","","6.0","101","2015","comedy, drama, music","6214","2015-08-05","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3623726/"
