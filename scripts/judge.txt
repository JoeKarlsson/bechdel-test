EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE (CHICAGO) — DAY
A nine—story slab of grey granite. An architectural
threat. The fast clip of wing—tips tap—tap marble.
INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE—CORRIDOR — DAY
MIKE KATTAN, 4Os, veteran prosecutor, strides, heated.
INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE—MEN'S BATHROOM — DAY
Empty save for a SUIT at a urinal, back to us. Urine
tickles porcelain, he exhales. Hums.
The door bangs open, Kattan charges in, loud.
KATTAN
Palmer, you lying motherfu——
A strong arc of PISS strafes Kattan across the knees.
Kattan brakes, gapes at the stain, then to——
HANK PALMER, 4Os, top criminal defense attorney,
considers the wet streak, Kattan. Returns to the urinal
KATTAN
You meant to do that.
HANK
(urine flows)
No. I don't think I did.
Kattan rips handfuls of paper towels, dabs at his pants.
KATTAN
This wasn't some West Englewood
drug sweep! The search was good.
No chance Meyers tosses it.
HANK
That's why we call this an
”evidentiary” hearing.
KATTAN
So you can smear me? Imply I
invented a phantom witness?
Hank smiles, heads for a sink, begins to wash up. His
silence baits Kattan.

KATTAN
The jaded lawyer with no respect
for the law. Original.
HANK
I respect the law. I'm just not
in awe of it.
Kattan gives up, eyes the piss—rags, disgusted
KATTAN
You were a solid, respected
prosecutor. The hell happened to
you——
HANK
Do your job, Kattan. If the great
state of Illinois can't meet its
burden of proof, it's on you if I
walk with a guilty client. Now
what's the cliche you followed me
in to the pisser to unload?
Involve my reflection? Maybe
sleeping at night, how I do it?
(his phone rings)
In a perfect Highland Park home
next to a loving wife with the ass
of a high school volley—baller.
Hank checks caller I.D., frowns. Heads out.
KATTAN
How does it feel, Hank? Really?
Knowing every person you represent
is good for it?
HANK
Christ, I hope so. Innocent
people scare the shit out of me.
INT COOK COUNTY COURTROOM — DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
Hank and another KENNER—BLOOM LAWYER, 3Os, at the defense
table The client; an antsy Insurance Company CEO, 5Os
KENNER—BLOOM LAWYER
A thousand says he doesn't bite.
Kattan sits across the aisle, a FEMALE PROSECUTOR
whispers to him, glances at the defense. Hank's
Blackberry vibrates on the table.

Hank keys
CEO
If I lose, I'm going to prison.
For a very long time. Stop
gambling with my life.
HANK
Mr. Stipe, Judge Meyers is about
to walk in, take a seat, and ask
if there is anything either side
would like to add before he rules
on my motion to suppress the files
found on your home computer. A
motion he will deny——
(CEO's face falls)
Meyers is elected, not appointed.
CEO
He's still a judge.
HANK
And you're the CEO of a Fortune
5OO insurance company charged with
strategically denying coverage to
terminally ill policy holders.
Fraud, corruption, manslaughter...
You're an election year attack ad.
his voicemail, listens.
HANK
But the prosecution isn't the
judge of character I am. He's
indecisive, worried. Wet. Any
second now that chippie will
hustle upstairs where his
informant —— in my opinion your
former mistress —— is sitting in a
spare office reading old InStyles.
A mistress I need him to identify
so I can disembowel her at trial.
The three watch Kattan's assistant stand, hurry out
CEO, Lawyer turn as CHICAGO JUDGE enters. Hank frozen
CHICAGO JUDGE
Before I rule on the defense
motion, is there anything either
of you would care to add?
KATTAN
Yes, your honor...

4.
KENNER—BLOOM LAWYER
We didn't shake on that.
Loss, disbelief on Hank's face. He rises, unfocused.
KATTAN
We'd like to remove any doubt as
to the validity of our search and
reveal the identity of our inform——
HANK
Approach, your honor?
Chicago Judge waves Hank in, Kattan joins him.
HANK
I need a continuance——
KATTAN HANK
Absolutely not—— Three, four days tops.
CHICAGO JUDGE
Grounds?
HANK
My mother died this morning.
KATTAN
(exasperated)
My ass.
EXT. HANK’S HOME — DAY
Upper middle class. Hank's Jaguar askew in the driveway.
INT. HANK’S HOME—GARAGE — DAY
Next to a Mercedes SUV, piles of men's clothes lie draped
atop packed boxes. Somebody moving in, more likely out.
EXT. HANK’S HOME—BACK YARD — DAY
Hank drags a sputtering hose to wilting hydrangeas. His
daughter, LAUREN, 6, wrestles with the kinked hose.
HANK
(into Blackberry)
Does anybody really look at prayer
cards, Glen? Pick a saint, any——
(points to hose)
(MORE)

HANK (CONT'D)
Un—kink it, Sweetie. No, twist.
(back to Glen)
So we're all staying at the house,
right? If I get there and find
out it's just me and the Judge, I
will spray the place with shit...
Look, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Hank disconnects. Lauren grabs the flowing hose.
LAUREN
You have a potty mouth.
HANK
Tell me about it.
LAUREN
Why can't I go with you?
HANK
Maybe next time.
LAUREN
Grandpa Palmer's your daddy?
HANK
He is.
LAUREN
Why do you call him the Judge?
HANK
That's who he is.
LAUREN
Are you sad over Grandma Palmer?
He gently pushes her hands down, waters the roots.
HANK
Yes, Lauren. I am.
LAUREN
I should go with you then.
She grins, yields the hose, pats his trouser pocket
HANK
Looking for something?
(she nods)
How do we ask?

6.
LAUREN
You got my Bit O'honey, old man?
Hank pulls the candy out, she snaps it up, both happy.
HANK
Hey. Who loves you?
LAUREN
You do, daddy.
INT. HANK’S HOME—BEDROOM — DAY
Hank packs a suitcase, ignores his hovering soon—to—be—ex
LISA, 3Os. Her best days de—flowered by Hank.
LISA
Can I do something? They're my in-
laws, we should all——
HANK
I got your idiot lawyer's letter.
LISA HANK
Hank, come on—— What'd I tell you?
LISA
You work seventy hours a week...
HANK
You poor thing; your soon to be ex-
husband has a strong work ethic.
LISA
You'll get her ready for school?
Make sure she has clean clothes?
That match? Fix breakfast, pick
her up, take her to dance,
Brownies, soccer? Get her
homework done every night, her
reading? You never so much as
changed one diaper when she——
(voice cracks)
Did I screw up? Absolutely. Do I
wish I could turn back the clock?
Every day. But I won't let you
punish her for it, Hank, I won't.
HANK
“Let” doesn't figure in this.
When I find a place, we're gone.

7.
LISA
Hank——
HANK
And while I'm providing our
daughter with incidentals like
food, clothing, shelter, you can
surf Facebook, friend another
college boyfriend, have lunch,
reconnect. Ball your brains out.
Lisa quick—checks the open door for little ears.
HANK
Focus. You don't want to go head
to head with me in court. I.
Don't. Lose. Think that's going
to change when it's my daughter on
the line? Whatever else you may
be, you're not stupid, Lisa. Lean
on that.
(zips suitcase)
Still want to know if you can do
something? For me?
She wipes her tears as he picks up the suitcase.
HANK
Water. The fucking. Hydrangeas.
INT./EXT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING) — DAY
Rural Indiana interstate. Hank's rental blows past --
Oceans of knee—high corn... grain silos and farm houses.
Red—tailed hawks perch on power lines, wait, watch.
On a TWO—LANE... Faded Bible verse signs nailed to cattle
fences. A weathered DOT sign: "Carlinville 5 miles."
Trapped behind a huge sluggish tractor. Hank slaloms
back, forth, considers the shoulder.
HANK
(into phone)
The local zealot kept cell towers
five miles out of town, if I lose
you—— so, Suze, whatta we got?
He jerks the car back as a pick—up blurs by. Close.

8.
AIR HORN blares as a semi jumps him from behind. HOGS
peer at him from between slats of the passing trailer.
HANK
Get Cammaratta to continue Howe.
If they piss and moan, just set it
for trial. What else?
He guns it by the tractor.
HANK
Wonderful. Patch him through.
Hello? Arthur? Suzanne?
Dropped. He no—look passes the phone into the backseat.
EXT. COUNTRY LAKE — DAY
Hank ducks a tree limb, signal hunting.
HANK
(into Blackberry)
No, docket's clear... I know it's
a fucking Fortune 500 company.
Are you really reminding me how
big this is, Arthur? Me?
He scoops a flat stone from the Earth. Rubs dirt off it
HANK
No, they're “our” billable hours
and “my” reputation. I'll see you
Monday.
(disconnects; sotto)
Forty—eight hours. In. Out. Let
it all just slide off your back.
Hank glances about. This place has meaning to him. A
past. He side—arm whips the stone. SPLOOSH. No skip.
INT./EXT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING) — DAY
Main Street Carlinville... Store—front businesses,
pedestrians. Hank reclines, slings his right arm across
the seat back.
A pick—up rumbles in the opposite direction, the driver
raises one index finger off the wheel “hello.”
Hank lifts a finger in reply. Instantly disgusted with
himself, he plants both hands on the wheel, straightens.

9.
INT. FUNERAL HOME—LOBBY — DAY
Hank focuses on... A small sign, magnetic letters: Rose
Room, 5:OO—8:OO p.m. MARY PALMER.
Hank unable to move.
INT. FUNERAL HOME—ROSE ROOM — DAY
Flowers. Alone, Hank crosses... Open casket. His eyes
settle on the body of MARY PALMER, 7Os, hands folded.
His breath catches.
He strokes her fingers. On the edge of undone. VIDEO
POV: Hank struggles, his back to us.
DALE (o.s.)
Hey, Hank.
Hank wipes wet eyes, turns, accepts what he sees.
HANK
Hey, Dale.
POV shaky, Hank and his younger brother DALE, 3Os, hug.
POV ends. Dale lowers his camera, appears a tad
disheveled, handsome—ish, “off.”
DALE
You look a touch outta round.
(gives a second hug)
Her heart just kinda turned off.
Hank's throat lumps. Dale has prayer cards, offers one
DALE
St. Francis. I picked. He was
her favorite. Friend to the
birds, like mom. Gotta remember
to put food out for them.
‘Specially in the winter. He's
gentle, like mom used to be.
Hank pretends to study St. Francis, fights tears——
DALE
Ran the snakes out of Indiana.
HANK
Again?

1O.
DALE
St. Francis. He scared the snakes
outta Indiana. Don't ask me how.
HANK
Ireland. Out of Ireland.
DALE
Busy guy.
HANK
No. Snakes are your constant.
But St. Patrick, not Francis. And
Ireland. Not Indiana.
DALE
(displays a card)
That's French Lick.
HANK
It's Italy, Dale, he's Italian.
(eyes prayer card)
Nothing. Trust me, nobody's
dispersing reptiles in Indiana.
They face their mom for a beat, Hank knows it's coming——
DALE
Were you there?
HANK
(smirks; loving)
I was not there.
GLEN (o.s.)
I don't know whether to shit or go
blind...
Hank's older brother GLEN, 4Os, ex—athlete faded to soft,
tired eyes, crosses the room. FUNERAL DIRECTOR trails.
GLEN
Hank Palmer in Carlinville.
HANK
Christ, Glen, what's she feeding
you? Can you still climb a
pitcher's mound?
Glen with a weight—of—the—world sigh, shakes Hank's hand.
DALE
Glen.

ll.
Dale extends a hand to Glen, who one—pumps it, annoyed
GLEN
I see you everyday, Dale.
(to Hank)
Where's the family?
HANK
Couldn't make it, school and all.
GLEN
Kids in Chicago go to school in
the summer do they?
Hank ignores the question, telegraphs his answer.
FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Hank, my condolences. So, fellas——
(hesitates)
Your mother seems to have passed
without funeral insurance——
GLEN HANK
We'll figure it out, Jerry. What's the damage?
FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Just north of fourteen thousand.
Hank produces a black AMEX. Glen chafes, subordinated
HANK
We can settle up later.
DALE
Not with me. Thanks Hank.
HANK
Where is he anyway?
EXT. COURTHOUSE — DAY (ESTABLISHING)
l800s era. A silver dome. Roman columns. Majestic.
DEADBEAT DAD (PRE—LAP V.O.)
Whatta ya want to hear? Nobody's
hiring, you can't get spinach from
a turnip. Get whoever did that to
her to pay child support.
