                                                          FIRST DRAFT




          HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at
          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           You have a choice in this world, I
           believe, about how to tell sad
           stories.

          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"
          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           On the one hand, you can sugar coat
           - the way they do in movies and
           romance novels.

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH
          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
          She rests her head on his shoulder.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Where villains are vanquished
           and... heroes are born and...
          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... beautiful people learn
           beautiful lessons...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.
          They look deep into one another's eyes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... and nothing is too messed up
           that can't be fixed with an apology
           and a Peter Gabriel song.

          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I like that way as much as the next
           girl, believe me. It's just not the
           truth.

          Hazel closes her eyes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           This is the truth.
          And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Sorry.

           FADE IN ON:

           2.



          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY /n
          The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Late in the Winter of my 17th
           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... my mother decided I was
           depressed.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
          to the DOCTOR:

                          FRANNIE
           ... she eats like a bird. She
           barely leaves the house,

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed.

                          FRANNIE
           ... she reads the same book over
           and over...

                          DOCTOR
           She's depressed.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed!

          Off her look, CUT TO:
          QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           The booklets and web sites always
           list depression as a side effect of
           cancer...

          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,
          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.
          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.

           3.



                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           Depression's not a side effect of
           cancer...

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
          Hazel eyes them with indifference.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... it's a side effect of dying.

          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
          - goes back to the book.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           Which is what was happening to me.

          And we CUT BACK TO:



          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SAME

          Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to
          dangle her feet.

                          FRANNIE
           ... some days she won't even get
           out of bed.
          The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.

                          DOCTOR
           I may switch you to Zoloft. Or
           Lexapro. And twice a day instead of
           once.

                          HAZEL
           Why stop there?

                          DOCTOR
           Hmm?
