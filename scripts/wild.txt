WILD Blue (09/30/2013) l.
EXT. PACIFIC CREST TRAIL — DAY _
A breathtakingly beautiful and remote part of northern
California — luridly green forests, forbidding mountains, an
enormous sky. No signs of civilization anywhere. We can hear
the sound of human breathing, though — her breath is ragged,
maybe distressed.
And now we see a hiking boot that clearly has something to do
with the breathing. It's not on a foot — it's perched on a
rock. _ '
The boot’s owner is CHERYL, filthy, possibly blonde hair, her
face and legs covered in cuts and bruises. On the ground
beside her is an enormous back-pack, as big as she is,
almost. She's trying to remove the other boot, a process
that's causing her immense pain.
The boot comes off. She throws it down beside the other one.
Now all she needs to do is peel off the blood—stained sock.
She tears the sock off in one fast agonizing movement. She
winces and curses.
Close on her exposed foot, which is a raw, pulpy mess. One of
her toenails is loose. She sings...
CHERYL
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail... »"
...takes a deep breath, and suddenly rips the entire toenail
off.
This causes a chain reaction. She twists away in pain, and
knocks the giant back-pack over. The back-pack falls against
the boot, and bounces it towards the edge of the path where
it topples down and deep into the woods below. Cheryl stands
up and peers down in disbelief.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
No.
She sits back down and takes off her other boot. This time
she gets the boot and the sock off in seconds. She must feel
the pain, but her anger and despair trump it.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
FUCK YOU, BITCH!
She stands up and HURLS the one remaining boot down into the
woods towards its mate.
As it falls, a SUDDEN RUSH of disconnected images — a syringe
going into an ankle...

Her voice bounces off the rocks.
The TITLE appears over black: WILD.
EXT. ROADSIDE — MOJAVE, CALIFORNIA — DUSK
An old pickup pulls up outside a motel near Mojave. The neon
Sign - WHITE'S MOTEL - TELEVISION - VACANCY - is bright in
the twilight, like a Hopper painting. Cheryl gets out, starts
to collect her stuff from the back of the pickup - her
enormous back-pack, and two enormous plastic carrier bags
full of stuff. She puts the bags down, waves to the driver of
the pickup. 0
INT. MOTEL — DAY
Cheryl walks into the grubby lobby of the motel. The TV up on
the wall behind the desk is showing the OJ trial. The woman
behind the desk has her neck crooked uncomfortably so that
she can see it. Cheryl comes in, struggling with her bags.
She dumps them on the lobby floor. She's excited. The desk“
clerk swivels round and glares at her.
CHERYL
Hi. I'd like a room for the night,
please?
DESK CLERK
Eighteen dollars.
She looks over Cheryl's shoulder out of the glass door,
apparently checking something.
DESK CLERK (CONT'D)
Unless you have a companion joining you
later. If you have a companion, it's
more. '
CHERYL
I don't have a companion.
DESK CLERK
So it's eighteen dollars. For now.
CHERYL
It's going to stay eighteen dollars.

DESK CLERK
Unless someone comes later.
CHERYL
Someone won't.
DESK CLERK
He might.
Cheryl tries not to show impatience at the circularity of the
argument. She pulls out a twenty and pushes it across the
desk. The clerk takes the money and slides a form and a
ballpoint on a chain towards Cheryl. '
CHERYL
I've actually come here to hike the PCT,
so I'll have to leave the license number
part blank. No car.
If Cheryl was hoping for some friendly and curious
engagement, she's getting-nothing.
CHERYL (CONT'D)
And also... I don't have an address.
DESK CLERK
So put down your folks’ address. ,
Cheryl hesitates and then writes an address while the woman
goes back to watching the news report of the OJ trial.
DESK CLERK (CONT ' D) ,
You think he did it? I do. That man is
guilty as sin.
Cheryl picks up her bags.and, key in mouth, heads towards her
room.
INT. MOTEL ROOM — NIGHT
Cheryl is lying on the bed in the motel room, sipping cheap
wine from a plastic cup and watching TV with the sound down -
George Clooney is talking to a patient on ER. Beside her bed
there is a bucket, catching drips from some kind of plumbing
problem in the ceiling. The plop of the drip seems ominous.
She hasn't unpacked her stuff, which is still in carrier bags
on the floor. She's wearing a tank top, and on her left
deltoid we see a tattoo of a blue horse. It's fresh, and
\ I
rimmed with tiny scabs. She begins to pick them off, and one
starts to bleed slightly.

WILD Blue (09/30/2013) 4.
INT. MOTEL ROOM — NIGHT
Cheryl parts the curtain of her room and looks out into the
dark. Across the way there's a man, Cheryl's age, passably
attractive, smoking a cigarette. He sees her looking, and she
allows her gaze to linger a little longer than she should.
She drops the curtain. She picks up the phone in the room,
dials a number.
CHERYL \

Hey-
INT. APARTMENT — NIGHT
PAUL, Cheryl's age, handsome and likable, is in his kitchen,
cooking with a woman, 20s, both sipping wine. We see Paul's
tattoo, same place on the arm. ER is also playing on the TV
in the living room.
PAUL
(with equal feeling)
Oh. Hey. Hi.
He tucks the phone under his chin and gestures to the girl
that he'll be two minutes. He wanders into his living room.
PAUL (CONT'D)
You in Mojave?
CHERYL
Yeah. I just gave your address as my
address on the motel registration form.
It was the only one I could think of.
PAUL
That's cool. Any time.
CHERYL
If you see my brother, will you tell him
I made it this far? I don't suppose he'll
give much of a shit.
PAUL
No, he does, he will.
Paul doesn't want to get into a long conversation.
PAUL (com '13)
Listen, I'm cooking dinner for a friend,
and...

She tries to say it playfully, and fails.
PAUL
Does it make any difference?
A beat. Before she can answer...
PAUL (CONT'D)
You want to get into a discussion about
our sexual conduct?
CHERYL
I only called because I couldn't get
through to Leif.
PAUL
I want you to call. We're friends,
remember.
CHERYL
I Yes. Sorry.
They re-gather.
PAUL
No, I'm sorry.
CHERYL
For what?
PAUL
I don't know. I'm sorry you have to walk
a thousand miles just to... l
He trails off.
CHERYL
Yeah, finish that sentence. Why do I have
to walk a thousand miles?
Neither of them say anything. They watch George Clooney
instead.

Yeah. You want me to send anything else?

She doesn't say anything.

OK. I have to go.
CHERYL
So go.
PAUL
You finally got what you wanted.
CHERYL
What's that?
PAUL
To be alone.
Cheryl thinks about this for a moment.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Happy trails!
She hangs up. The drip-catching bucket is filling up. There's
a little puddle of water around it. She ignores it. She
strips off to take a shower.

WILD Pink (10/09/13) 7.

On the way to the bathroom she picks up the bucket, and
realizes that it has a hole in it. She snorts with bitter
amusement.
CHERYL
Figures.
INT. BATHROOM — NIGHT -
She dumps the water from the bucket into the bath, and
catches sight of herself in a mirror. She stares at herself
penetratingly. Her reflection saddens her.
Later. She's got wet hair and she's wearing a T—shirt. She
parts the curtains to see if the man's still there. He's
gone. She reaches for a small box: ‘The Loudest Whistle In
The World’, it says on it. She takes the whistle out and puts
it in her mouth. It stays silent.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
Cheryl is standing in the middle of the motel room beside her
enormous backpack, and looking around her, helplessly.
There is equipment on every available surface in the bedroom.
She sighs, takes her sleeping bag, stuffs it into the
backpack. Then her cooking pot, then her tent, then her
raincoat, then her lantern and a towel, toilet paper,
notebooks...
Later. The backpack is a marvel to behold. Everything has
been put away; there are things dangling from every piece of
the framework, and a complicated system of bungee cords. This
efficiency has come at some personal cost, though, because
Cheryl is red—faced and sweaty..
CHERYL
Oh, shit.
She has forgotten something. She starts to delve in the bag.

WILD Blue (09/30/2013) 8.
INT. MOTEL BATHROOM — MORNING 9
Cheryl is filling an apparently insatiable dromedary bag in
the bathroom sink. The dromedary bag is basically a giant
water balloon, heavy and hard to wrestle with; when Cheryl
has filled it and sealed it, she picks it up. It's clearly
heavy and slippery, and it immediately squirms out of her
grasp and onto the floor. She picks it up again and works out
a way to carry it as far as the bedroom. '
INT. BEDROOM — MORNING lO
And now, miraculously, the dromedary bag is attached to the
backpack. Cheryl is in an even worse state; she's sitting on
the floor next to the pack. There are large damp patches
around her armpits. She stands up, looks to her handiwork,
and then takes the backpack by the frame, just to test how
heavy it feels. The backpack doesn't move. She uses both _
hands... still nothing. She can't even lift it.
CHERYL
Jesus Christ.
She sits down in front of the pack, puts her arms through the
shoulder straps. She rocks backwards and forwards to gain
some momentum, and then shoots herself forward. If she was
hoping that the maneuver would end with her standing up,
she's disappointed; now she's on her hands and knees, trying
to stop the pack from pushing her onto her belly.
She crawls forward a couple of inches, puts a hand on the
metal cooling unit in the room, using this to give herself
some leverage.
Slowly, she manages to get to her feet — her head rises, her
knees straighten. She's basically in an Olympic weight-
lifting stance, and if the object of the exercise were to get
herself into a standing position wearing an enormous
backpack, then she's succeeded triumphantly.
EXT. GAS STATION — DAY ll
Cheryl is leaning against the wall beside a soda machine in a
gas station, chugging a soda greedily. Her backpack towers
above her head. She's already a hot and disheveled mess.
She's peopleewatching, apparently trying to work out which of
the gas station's customers she might approach for a lift.
The mother with three squabbling children is easy to
discount; so too the sinister—looking man with hooded eyes, a
pony—tail and a scar down one cheek.

She likes the look of a pair of men who may well be father
and son — the father is fiftyish, the son is 16 — in a van.
As the father is about to open the van door, Cheryl
approaches him unsteadily.
CHERYL
Hi. You driving west?
MAN
(reluctantly)
) Yeah.
CHERYL ~
I'm going to Tehachapi Pass?
The man shrugs.
MAN
OKI
Cheryl walks over to the car, and then realizes that she has
no easy way of climbing into the back seat. She opens the car
door, sits on the edge of the seat with her legs on the
ground, lies down and wriggles out of the backpack.
INT. VAN - DAY 12
Cheryl, happy in the back seat of the van without her pack '
on.
MAN A
So what's going on at Tehachapi Pass?
CHERYL
I'm hiking the PCT from there.
MAN
I don't know what that is.
CHERYL
The Pacific Crest Trail. Runs from the
Mexican border to Canada. I'll be walking
for the next three months.

Yeah. I mean, I'm not an obsessive. This
is still, you know... quite a stretch for
me.
MAN
So we're going to be your last human
company for a while.
CHERYL
I guess that's right. I should make the
most of the conversational opportunities.
They almost immediately lapse into a silence... broken by the
man, who turns the car radio on and searches for music. The
Shangri-Las' “I Can Never Go Home Anymore" suddenly plays.
The son seems annoyed by his father's music selection. Cheryl
looks out the window at the arid landscape, and smiles.
INT. BOBBI’S HOUSE. DAY A12
BOBBI, Cheryl's mother — thirtyish, attractive, bright—eyed,
arty, hippy, energetic — is dancing to the Shangri—Las tune
with seven—year—old Cheryl. Their house is comfortable,
cheaply but imaginatively furnished, full of colour. Cheryl
and Bobbi have a whole choreographed routine to accompany the
Shangri—Las’ song which they perform with perfect seriousness
while doing the dishes. The girls stop dancing when Cheryl's
four—year-old brother LEIF turns the music off.
INT. VAN — DAY B12
The son just switched the radio off and goes back to his
reading. His father looks at him.
THE MAN
I love you too, son.
The father shakes his head, visibly hurt. No signs of
compassion from the son who keeps on reading.
Cheryl goes back to her daydreaming.
SOUNDLESS FLASHBACK: C12
We're back at Bobbi's house. Bobbi holds her hands a couple
of inches apart. Young Cheryl and Leif start to smile and
shake their heads no. Bobbi moves her hands further apart.
The kids shake their heads again. Bobbi's arms are stretched
as wide as they can go. This is the children's cue for a hug.
They run into her arms.

Even though we don't really understand what's going on (we
will later), this demonstration of love and happiness would
put a smile on anyone's face...
... but not on Cheryl's as she keeps looking out the window.
EXT. ROADSIDE — DAY 13
The van pulls off the road and Cheryl gets out. The man opens
the door and walks round to help her. With enormous effort,
Cheryl drags the backpack down the seat. The man takes over,
picks it up, drops it down with an alarming thump. He's
clearly taken aback by the weight.
MAN
You're going to put that on your back?
Because I couldn't_put it on mine.
CHERYL
Oh, you get used to it.
The man stands there for a moment, waiting for her to put it
on. He wants to see that she can.
Cheryl smiles at him, not willing to do it in front of him.
There's a standoff for a moment.
CHERYL (CONT'D)
Thanks for the ride.
The man stares at her for a moment longer, realizes that
she's waiting until he's gone, and gives up.
MAN
Be safe out there.
CHERYL
I will.
He gets back in the van and drives off. Cheryl sits down in
the dirt and adopts the position she needs to get the pack on
her back.
She looks around her. She's on the edge of the desert. Dust
is blowing around her feet; she's surrounded by the mountains
of the Sierra Nevada. It's already hot. She sees a fence-post
a few yards away, and walks towards it.
There's a small metal sign that says PACIFIC CREST TRAIL;
underneath the sign is a small metal box. She opens it and
takes out the notebook and pen inside. This is the trail
register. She writes in the book. What she has written
appears on the screen in her handwriting:

DICKINSON (AND CHERYL STRAYED)”
She begins to walk. She's happy, confident, excited.
CARD ON SCREEN: DAY 1
EXT. PACIFIC CREST TRAIL - DAY 14
Close on Cheryl's face. She's sweating and breathing hard.
The confidence and excitement is fading out. The breathing
forms only one part of a complicated rhythm track which
involves her footsteps, the creaking of the pack and the
sloshing of the water container. She grimaces with pain and
attempts to adjust her pack. She's trying not to collapse
under its weight...as we see the fenceepost with the trail
register maybe a hundred yards behind her.
EXT. TRAIL — DAY 15
Later. The same sort of terrain — a rocky, occasionally steep
trail, scrubby, dry bushes. The fence-post is still visible,
only a little further away. Sweat is stinging her eyes and
blurring her vision. The pack is agony.
CHERYL (v.o.)
What the fuck have I done? What the fuck?
What we hear is Cheryl's MIX-TAPE RADIO. It's the sound of
her head, a jumble of oaths and songs and poems and adverts
and, occasionally, cogent thought, and we have access to it
throughout the movie.
CHERYL (V.O.)
What... the... FUCK... what... the...
FUCK... what... the... FUCK
This cri de coeur becomes another instrument to add to the
cacophony of her walking rhythm.
EXT. TRAIL — DAY 16
Cheryl stops walking, out of breath, and turns around. We can
still see the fence-post - only just, but it's there. She
shakes her head, turns again and keeps walking.

EXT. TRAIL — DAY A16
Cheryl stops again, even more out of breath, her face red.
She makes an effort to take her backpack off but stops. Too
painful. She rests her pack against a large rock, unbuckles
it and reaches over to a sage bush. She picks a handful of
the leaves, rubs them between her palms, and puts her face in
them, inhaling deeply. She looks at the blue sky, breathes
in, brings her self up, and keeps on walking.
OMITTED 17
EXT. TRAIL — DAY 18
Cheryl puts her backpack down and rests on all fours,
exhausted and shaken. She rummages around in her pack and
pulls out a chair, her tent, the stove and a couple of books -
her guide and her copy of Adrienne Rich's Dream Of A Common
Language. We watch as Cheryl struggles to erect or even
understand her tent, even though it's nowhere near sunset.
Later. Finally, the tent is up, her camping seat is
positioned at the entrance. Cheryl is on her knees, examining
the stove. She sighs at the effort involved in lighting it,
and pulls from her pack some tuna jerky and a small packet of
nuts. She sits wearily down on the seat and looks at her pack
that stands against a Joshua tree. It's enormous. She looks
around, shakes her head, and begins to.write in a small book.
CHERYL (V.O.)
I thought of you today. I felt a burst of
energy, remembering why I thought I could
hike this trail. Hope you won't be mad at
me... l

Cheryl puts her diary down, takes Adrienne Rich's book and
begins to read the poetry aloud to herself.

INT. CLASSROOM — COLLEGE — DAY 19
The book is now on a desk in a classroom. A younger Cheryl,
surrounded by fellow students, is looking at it. It's being
read out loud by a lecturer — wild grey hair, alternative, an
old—school feminist. - '
LECTURER
What I'd like you to think about for next
week - and to make myself plain,
"thinking about" actually means writing,
in essay form...
Chuckles and groans from the students.
LECTURER (CONT'D)

Simple as that. So all you need to dd is
go away and find out about Adrienne
Rich's life, and the history of American
, poetry, and you're all set.
More chuckles and groans.

Thank you.
Cheryl stands up, puts her book in her book bag.

A bustle of students and teachers between classes. Cheryl
almost bumps into a woman going the other direction. They
carry on walking. Cheryl thinks about it, then spins around.

A quick glance at the book.

“Denying her wounds came from the same
source as her power."
Close on Cheryl's face. We don't know what's going on with
this poem and these memories, but they cause her pain.
INT. TENT — DUSK 23
Cheryl reading in her tent with her head—lamp. She puts the
book down, turns the light off, lies in the dark. There are
noises everywhere - animals in the distance, breeze in the
scrub, thunder a long way away. She puts the light on again.
She's scared. Her head turns towards the noises on either
side of her. She turns the lamp off again.
BLACK 24
We hear the sounds that Cheryl was hearing, but louder. We
start to see some grain in the darkness as we become used to
it. There's a movement — the silhouette of a wild animal in
the foreground. Suddenly a light appears in the distance:
Cheryl's tent, a tiny bright dot in an inhospitable
landscape. The animal freezes. It's a Jack rabbit, a long way
away.

CARD ON SCREEN — DAY 3
The usual walking rhythm - slosh, creak, thump. There is
something else that's making her uncomfortable, however, on
top of the pain in her shoulders and hips and feet. She's in
a cold sweat. She stops, takes off her pack, rummages inside
and pulls out a small trowel and some toilet paper. She walks
off the trail a few yards, squats down and tries to dig in
the dirt with the trowel. Nothing doing — she can't penetrate
the dry, rocky surface. She's getting desperate — she starts
trying to use the trowel as a pickaxe. Still nothing. She
hurls the trowel down on the ground in disgust, fumbles with
her trousers, takes them off, kicks them well away and
squats. Her face registers relief. Afterwards she collects .
stones and places them on and around her own excrement.
Later. Cheryl clears her throat and starts talking to
herself.
CHERYL
“So, Cheryl...What do you do for fun?
When you're not hiking?” “Oh, I like to
sit on a real toilet, with a seat and a
flush. And I like to cook. Like, food. I
like to cook food and eat it. I love
music. Songs. I love the sound of the
human voice. I like listening to people.
That's a hobby of mine I hadn't even
noticed until I started walking on my own
through the fucking desert."

It's even hotter, if anything, and Cheryl is scarcely
recognizable as the woman we saw talking to Paul in the hotel
room. She's a different colour from the sun and the dirt and
the blood, and she's already thinner. She's sitting on the
side of the trail, boots off, pulling all the available cold
food she has, the nuts and the power bars and the jerky, and
laying it out in a line. There isn't much of it. She unwraps
a power bar, swallows it in two bites, chases it down with'
some warm water. She's still starving. She unwraps another
one. It makes no difference. I
CHERYL
OK. We need to feed you, kid.
Further along the same stretch, Cheryl is standing by a dirt
track leading off the trail. She has a compass in one hand
and a map in the other. She starts to walk up the dirt track.
EXT. TRACK — DAY 3O
Cheryl walking through a completely uninhabited landscape.
CHERYL
”PotaTO, poTAto, tomaTO, toMAto...Shut

She hums the melody line from "Let's Call The Whole Thing

doesn't remind her of her hunger. .

Dusk, and the landscape hasn't changed much - there's still
no sign of life, the energy has gone from Cheryl's singing,

the songs.
CHERYL (v.o.)
”PotaTO, poTAto, tomaTO, toMAto”..
Please, make it stop.

I hate this song.
Cheryl rounds a bend and sees, off in the distance, a pick—up
truck parked on a road, and behind it in a field, the lights
of a tractor suddenly appearing. She runs towards them.

EXT. ROAD - DUSK 33
Cheryl, standing in the tractor's path, waving at the driver.
He stops the tractor. This is FRANK, a very large white man,
wearing a cowboy hat. He is clearly nonplussed by the
appearance of this beaten-up, filthy woman.
CHERYL -
Hello. Hi. I'm Cheryl, and I'm walking
the PCT, and I've run out of food, and I
just need to get somewhere so that I can
- buy a hot meal. And you're the first
.person I've talked to in eight days who
isn't me.

Even if you just left me outside a place

Frank looks at her. ,
FRANK _
You must be pretty hungry. 2
CHERYL
I had all these dehydrated meals, but I
can't heat them up because I brought the
wrong fuel, and... yeah, I'm kind of
desperate.
FRANK
I got another thirty minutes or so to do
here. You can sit in my truck.
He gestures to the pick—up parked on the road. Cheryl watches
him leaves. /
INT. PICK—UP TRUCK — DUSK 34
Cheryl watches Frank driving up and down in a field in the
distance. She sniffs the air in the truck, and then sniffs
her clothes and her armpits - what she can smell is herself.
She winds the window down. When she knows Frank can't see,
she opens the glover compartment and finds a silver whiskey
flask; she screws it open, takes a sip. She reaches under the
driver's seat and finds a black case. Inside: a gun.
LATER — NIGHT A34
Frank gets into the truck. '
FRANK
I've been thinking. You can come home
with me. Dinner and a shower.
Cheryl is alarmed, but is trying to stay calm.

She laughs, trying to give the impression of being at ease.
FRANK (CONT'D)
I've got a little something for us.
He leans across Cheryl, opens the glove compartment, takes
out the flask and hands it to her.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Ladies first.
Cheryl takes a sip from the flask.
FRANK (CONT'D)
I'm going to call you Jane.
He starts to drive.
CHERYL
I'm not out here on my own, actually. My
husband Paul is a little further ahead on
the trail. But we're meeting up soon. At
Kennedy Meadows, probably.
Frank takes the flask from her, takes a long sip.
FRANK
There's something else I like to do when
I finish work.
He looks at Cheryl. He's impossible to read. As he's driving
with one hand on the wheel, Frank reaches beneath his seat,
where the gun is. Cheryl grips the door handle, preparing to
open it and jump out. Frank comes up with a clear bag, pulls
out a thick lasso of red licorice, holds it out to Cheryl.
FRANK (CONT'D)
You want some, Miss Jane?
Cheryl takes it, gratefully, and crams it into her mouth.

Through the windshield, we're approaching a house in the

INT. FRANK'S HOUSE — NIGHT 35
Frank and his wife live in a small, spotlessly clean, three-
room house. The TV is blaring away — more news of the OJ
trial, in front of two empty chairs that clearly belong to
heavy people. Frank's wife Annette, a large woman, appears
from the kitchen and places large quantities of food, ribs,
greens and corn on the table. Cheryl can't take her eyes off
it. She moves towards a chair so that she can dig in.
ANNETTE
Hold on, sweetheart. No offence, but...
She picks up the newspaper from the table, removes a couple
of pages, puts them over Cheryl's chair. Cheryl looks
mortified. 3
Later. Frank and his wife have finished eating, but Cheryl is
still going. Her plate is full of rib bones.
FRANK
You meet your husband at college?
She remembers what she told him in the truck.
CHERYL
Oh. Paul. Yeah.
FRANK
He must be even crazier than you. One
thing going on a hike like that when
you're a man. Another thing letting your
wife do it.
ANNETTE
Not everyone in the world thinks like
you, Frank.
FRANK
No, and it's why the world is all messed
up.

the water is running almost black. The hot water on her body
is as intense an experience as the food was... until she
touches her tattoo.
INT. TATTOO PARLOUR — DAY 37
Close on the blue horse being created by a tattooist - except
as the camera pulls back, it's clear that the shoulder
providing the canvas belongs to a man — Paul. Cheryl is
watching. She's revolving her shoulder gently. The tattooist
is a woman, tattoos everywhere: neck, arms, hands. Paul
winces.
TATTOOIST
So what does this horse mean to you guys?
PAUL
Well, we both really dig horses.
CHERYL
We're actually getting divorced. This
afternoon. So we wanted something that, I
don't know. Bound us together forever.
She's emotional, although the tattooist doesn't notice.
TATTOOIST
It hasn't occurred to you that it might
be less painful to stay married? Cheaper,
too.
Paul smiles, and sees an opportunity to get the conversation
off their relationship.
PAUL
Well, at least we probably won't regret
it. Couples don't necessarily stay
married, but they tend to stay divorced.
The tattooist smiles.

removing tattoos...

PAUL
It's quite a big slate.

I cheated on him many times, and I don't

him. He deserves so much better.
The tattooist carries on with the job in silence.
A37 INT. PAUL AND CHERYL'S APARTMENT — DAY ‘
Close on a hand made book on which it's written The Day The
Daisies Bloomed. Next to it, a dictionary.
That is Cheryl's POV as she sits on the sofa reading
something that makes her smile and look at Paul who is
gathering all the legal papers spread on the table.
PAUL
Anyone who gives their marriage vows a
title like that is by definition too
young to get married.
Cheryl goes back to her reading... and stops, choked by an
emotion.
Paul notices and looks at her with compassion.

I hope you can do that someday with
someone else.

Paul opens the door. Cheryl stops him from going inside.

Paul rolls his eyes affectionately.
CHERYL (CONT'D)
I mean, I know we're not sure sure,
because we've been going back and forth
for months. But right now? Today?
Paul sighs helplessly.
PAUL
Yep. Today. Now.
INT. OFFICE — DAY 39
The notary public, VAL, is very small, mid-thirties, with
cropped hair, dyed bright blonde apart from a streak of pink.
She has tattoos too. She's a punk notary. She's examining the
divorce papers while Paul and Cheryl watch. We can see that
they're holding hands.
VAL
Is that right? 'Stry-ed’?
CHERYL
It's just 'Strayed'. Like a stray dog.
She looks at Paul. He smiles. No comment.
CHERYL (CONT'D)
I needed a new name and I saw that word
in a book and... you know all the
meanings? I looked it up. “To wander from
the proper path, to be lost, to be

She stops talking. Val decides to study the papers one last
time as a way of avoiding eye-contact. She puts them in an
envelope and thrusts them across the table towards Cheryl.

You're all set. You have to mail them
yourselves. Good luck.
Cheryl won't take them. Paul does.

the envelope through the slot. It seems brutal, given the
atmosphere of indecision and love. ,

Cheryl, finishing her shower — just letting the water wash
over her, still. She finishes the shower and gets out. She
starts to dry herself, winces. She looks at herself in the
bathroom mirror, puts her arms out straight on either side of
her. There are wounds everywhere: her tailbone and her hips
and her shoulders have all been rubbed raw by her pack. She
shakes her head. She looks like she's paying for somebody's

But don't listen to me. I've quit a bunch
of things. Jobs. A marriage. I'd have
quit your hike pretty much on the first
day. _

And do you regret any of them?
Frank thinks.
FRANK
I never had the choice. I just couldn't
do them. Wasn't never a time when it felt
like there was a fork in the road.
Cheryl thinks about this.

The old, familiar, nightmarish rhythm: the sloshing of the
bag, the creak of the pack, the pounding of the feet. The
trail is steep at this point.
She's so focused on her rhythm that she fails to hear a new
instrument in the mix. As well as the creak and the plod and
the slosh there's a rattle. She ignores it for a few secondsf_"
then realizes what it is and stops dead. At her feet there is
a huge rattlesnake. -
She scrambles backwards and;stands stock-still, staring at
it. She's petrified. Her breathing is heavy and fast - she
tries to slow it, and regafh self—control.
CHERYL .
Listen... I just want to scoot right by
you there.
She makes a slithering gesture with her hand.
CHERYL (CONT'D)
OK? I'll get on'with my day, you get on
with yours...
The snake stays put. She gets ready to move, then changes her
mind.
Cut to later: Cheryl and the rattlesnake are in identical
positions.
And later: Cheryl is a little further back, sipping water
from a bottle.
And later: Cheryl preparing to move again. This time she
moves. She takes as wide a berth as she can, and then runs as
fast as she can, given the weight of the pack, with the
occasional glance back.

You're doing it in front of me. And if
you're pregnant, we're going to pay a

Cheryl is shovelling the snow away from her car under the

keeps on shovelling, her mind spinning, and we can hear it.
It sounds like an engine blended with the repetitive noise of

Her POV: further ahead, Greg stops and turns. His pack is

about half the size of Cheryl's. And he has a trek
which he uses with a kind of nerdy enthusiasm.
GREG
Pretty big pack you've got there. Ray
Jardine would have a thing or two to say
about that.
CHERYL
I'll bet. And I really wish I knew who
Ray Jardine was.
GREG
He wrote the book on backpacking!
CHERYL

Oh. Well, I didn't read it.
Greg laughs.

You're doing fine, Cheryl. You're green,

Later. A rockfall has slowed Cheryl's progress. She can't go
round it: there's a sheer rock face on one side, a steep drop
into scrub on the other.
She has to clamber over it. She
chooses the easiest point and attempts to climb, but the pack
makes it impossible for_her. She removes the pack, and with
great effort manages to place it on the rocks in such a way
that she has a shot at retrieving it from the other side.
She climbs over the rock

ready for love..."
She sings out loud.

"Honey I'm tougher than the rest."
EXT. KENNEDY MEADOWS — DAY 57
Off in the distance, Cheryl can see the lodges of Kennedy
Meadows. Bruce Springsteen takes over in her head and the
world-weary ballad of survival has never sounded so
triumphant.
EXT. KENNEDY MEADOWS ~ DAY 58
Kennedy Meadows is a pleasant, welcoming campsite, with a L
cafe/restaurant, and a general store. There's a big banner
saying WELCOME TO KENNEDY MEADOWS, hanging from one of the
lodges, and Cheryl trudges wearily towards it; A group of
half—a-dozen men are drinking beers at a trestle table
nearby, and when they see Cheryl, they cheer. Cheryl smiles,
heads over to them. Greg is among them.

What can I get you?
CHERYL_
Snapple. I've been dreaming of Snapple.
And corn chips. Thank you. _
She produces a ten dollar bill from her shorts and hands it
to him.
GREG
And when you're done, Ed here will cook
you dinner at the camp site.
Ed, an older man, stout and bearded, beams at her amiably.
Cheryl looks bewildered by the kindness of strangers.
CLOSE—UP of four bottles of Snapple lined up on the table. We
see Cheryl's face, distorted and coloured by the drink but
still clearly full of longing, through the glass.
CHERYL
Oh my God.
She picks one of the bottles up and drains it, while the men
cheer as if this were some kind of keg party. In any other
context, you'd worry for her - a young blonde woman, a group
of men drinking beer. But it's Snapple, and it's Kennedy
Meadows, and these people are hikers, and it's all benign.
Cheryl drains the second bottle, too.
INT. GENERAL STORE » DAY 59
Cheryl is standing at the counter of the general stores. A
pleasant, middle—aged lady comes to serve her.

She scuttles off.
EXT. GENERAL STORE - DAY 60
Cheryl is sitting on the stoop, her face buried in a fresh T-
shirt that has obviously come from the open box beside her.
She puts it down, fishes around inside the box and pulls out
a twenty—dollar bill. She puts that in her pocket, and opens
the letter that she's received at the same time.
PAUL (v.o.)
Sweetheart...
Cheryl reacts to the salutation - it's a little stab.
PAUL (v.o.)
If you're reading this, then you've
walked a hundred miles through the Mojave
Desert. A hundred miles! Whatever else
has happened between us, however angry we

So actually, you've done almost nothing

Cheryl smiles.
EXT. CAMPSITE — DAY 61
Cheryl is paddling at the edge of the raging, icy-cold South
Fork Kern River.
She crouches down, splashes water on her face and hair and

behind from the campsite behind her.

ED
Not like you guys. I come here for the
summer and hang out with the real hikers.
You fascinate me.
CHERYL

I'm not a real hiker.
ED '
You just walked a hundred miles through
the desert heat.
CHERYL
And it nearly killed me.
ED
You want some help?
Cheryl pokes her bare, bloody, bruised feet in the air.
CHERYL
Do I look like someone who needs help?
ED
OK, so first of all: your boots are too
small. That's why you're losing toenails.
Cheryl laughs.
CHERYL
You're right. And I only just realized it
the second you told me. I just thought I
was supposed to hurt that bad. But I have
nothing else. And-no money.

Cheryl's belongings are spread out on a picnic table. Ed is
standing on one side of the table, Cheryl on the other.
ED
So... I'm going to pick out the stuff
that's useless to you, and you can leave
it in the free box unless you can give me
a good reason why you need it with you.

OK.
Ed picks up a stick of deodorant.

How's this working out for you?
Cheryl laughs.

armpits are the least of it.
Ed laughs and puts the deodorant down, the first item in a
pile of discards. Ed picks up a pair of miniature binoculars.

finds Kennedy Meadows. He takes a chunk of pages between his
fingers. -
ED (CONT'D)
You're done.
Ed tears the pages out, puts them down on his grill, sets
light to them. We watch them burn.
On the screen, we see a graphic image of the part of the
trail Cheryl has already walked going up in flames.
Ed picks up the O'Connor and the Adrienne Rich books.

never get burned.
Ed shrugs.

The discard pile has grown much bigger. We can see a
disposable razor, a flash for her camera...Ed picks up a fat
roll of condoms, and before Cheryl can stop_him, he has
unraveled them - he didn't know what they were. Cheryl,
excruciated, closes her eyes.

BOBBI.
Hey!
CHERYL
Oh, come on, Mom. James Michener? Gimme a

Bobbi sighs. Every mother who has had her taste and
intelligence insulted by a smart—mouthed daughter will
recognize her expression.
BOBBI
OK, so what's wrong with James Michener?
I enjoy his work. \
CHERYL
He's crap, that's what's wrong with him.

She starts to drive away — it becomes apparent that they live
in the middle of nowhere. -

CHERYL

You probably didn't come here to slide

about cheating yourself, make your hike

‘The Bridge Of The Gods’. I like the
sound of that.

I love Stevie Ray.
Dave pops a CD into the boom box that's propped between him
and Lou, and Stevie Ray Vaughan's “Texas Flood” loud blues
guitar fills the car. Cheryl grins. She's been starved of
music, and it sounds fantastic to her.
SPIDER

Put "Love—Struck” on.
I (to Cheryl)
Just came on me, the second you got in
the car.
LOU .
Oh, shut up, Spider. Jesus.

CHERYL
I'm sitting in a car with you right now.
That's not so tough.
DAVE
You know that story about the
motherfucking apes?
Cheryl, startled, shakes her head.
A DAVE (CONT’D)
So this scientist in Paris or wherever
the motherfuck it was, he was trying to
teach apes to draw. And he keeps showing
them art pictures, like motherfucking Old
Masters and shit, and he gives them I
charcoal pencils, and he's saying, come
on, ape motherfuckers, draw. And one day,
one of them draws a picture. You know
what he draws?
CHERYL
NO.
DAVE
The bars on his own motherfuckin' cage.
Can you relate to that, sister?
He turns and executes a complex biker handshake with Spider.
Cheryl catches Lou's eye in the rearview mirror. They smile.
Cheryl notices a laminated card dangling from the bottom of
the mirror. .
CHERYL
Cute boy. How old is he?
Lou doesn't say anything. She just turns the music down. They
drive on for a few moments. The mood is suddenly sombre.

He was eight.

herself.

Cheryl is pulling her pack out of the trunk of the car while
Dave, Spider and Lou light up cigarettes. The men walk Stevie
Ray into the tress by the side of the road while Lou watches
Cheryl put on Monster.
LOU
You're pretty.
CHERYL
Thank you. You too.

Aw, you're nice, but I know I'm not. I'm

Cheryl looks down at her legs, embarrassed.
LOU (CONT’D)
Nah, I'm just giving you shit. I think

INT. CAR — DAY 82
Cheryl and Bobbi are driving back from the hospital. This

silence.
BOBBI
I was never me.
CHERYL
Don't talk about yourself as if it's

someone who...
BOBBI I
I've always been somebody's daughter or
mother or wife. I never got to be in the
driver's seat of my own life. I thought
that would come. I thought time was

Cheryl doesn't know what to say. She's too young, and she's
too blind—sided by the news they have received, and by the
glaring sun that shines through the window.
EXT. TRAIL — DAY 83

Back to the familiar rhythm — the creak, the slosh, the
pounding. Cheryl is fitter now, can walk faster. And she's
angry — this is what thinking about her mother_does to her.
But the trail is heading quite steeply uphill — it's hard
going, and it hurts. And then, to the rhythm of her boots and
her squeaking pack...

EXT. SNOW LANDSCAPE — DAY 85
Cheryl battling with the snow. There is no trail any more -
just white, everywhere around her.

suddenly we're as startled as she is when something passes
behind her at lightning speed. She turns around.
Her POV: two SKIERS dangerously going down hill. Obviously,
pros. They're already very far when Cheryl shouts at them.

Cheryl waking up in her tent. She's wearing her wet weather
clothes, and she's sleeping with her food and her water, in
an attempt to keep it all from freezing. She opens her eyes
and stares woozily at the whorls of frost on the roof of the
tent. She unzips the tent, and we see her POV of the world

can sleep in this terrain, let alone hike.

beautiful fox glides over and sits a few paces away from hers
watching her without fear. Cheryl doesn't know whether to be

Bobbi is desperately sick and in pain. She looks at a MALE
NURSE next to her bed, with desperate eyes.
BOBBI
Mor... phine! Please!
Cheryl stands in a corner of the room, helplessly watching
her mother. While the nurse looks at his wristwatch, Cheryl
notices the outline of his penis through his tight nurse's
trousers. The nurse catches Cheryl's look.
Without a word, she walks into the small bathroom at the foot
of Bobbi's bed. The nurse joins Cheryl. She gets close to
him. Too close.
CHERYL
Help her, please.
She reaches for his sex as the door slowly closes...
The nurse is still looking at his watch when Cheryl gets out
of her daydream fantasy.

Cheryl puts her coat and hat on, and bends over to kiss her

We realize it's St. Patrick's Day — there are drunk green
people everywhere. Cheryl passes a bar with a big plate glass
window. We can't hear the noise, we can only see it — men and
women wearing green shirts and green hats and drinking green
beer. A drunk man catches Cheryl's eye, makes a sad face,
points at her and laughs. His friends turn to look, and they
start laughing too. I

gather. I guess the trail's a good place
for that. For people whose lives have
emptied out. I mean, look! _

This has the power to fill you up again
if you let it. I'm slowly learning to.
Cheryl laughs. Stacey wonders why.

a sunset and you can choose to be there
for it. You can put yourself in the way

Cheryl is in an empty, cheerless college classroom, sitting
on one side of a work-table on a plastic chair. On the other
side is a therapist, VINCE — fiftyish, grizzled, kind-
looking. Cheryl is drawn, pale, unkempt, red—rimmed
eyes;
she's at rock-bottom. She clearly doesn't want to be there.
CHERYL
I've been destroyed by her death. There's
nothing else to say about it.
Vince stays silent. A beat.
_ CHERYL (CONT’D)
I thought there'd be couches and
armchairs and books. And Kleenex.
VINCE .
That's fifty—bucks—an-hour therapy. This
is ten—bucks-an~hour therapy. Why do you
think you'd been destroyed by your
mother's death?
CHERYL
Is that what your job is? To ask the
bereaved if they're grieving too much?
VINCE
People grieve in all sorts of different
ways. I'm asking you about yours.
CHERYL
Is mine so bad?
VINCE
You're using heroin and you're having sex
with anyone who asks. I'm not sure that
these things are making you happy.

Do you sleep with your husband too?
CHERYL
No. I'm like a guy when it comes to sex.
I prefer to be detached.
VINCE 1
You think that's what guys are like?
Cheryl shrugs and stares at the poster behind him - a picture
of the universe, with an arrow pointing at a tiny dot and the
words “YOU ARE HERE’ beside it.
CHERYL
I see that poster all over the place. I
hate it. Who wants to teach kids that
they don't matter?
xxvince turns around to look at it.

Did you feel as though you mattered?
This gets to her, momentarily.
CHERYL
Yes. I know I did.
VINCE
So who detached from you? \
CHERYL
Oh, right. My mom dies, and we have to
talk about my dad. Jesus.
VINCE
So there's the answer to that particular
question.
CHERYL ,
Anyway. We detached from him.

Young Cheryl walks back into the house with Leif and Bobbi.

pump the brown liquid into the bottle.

hears a noise, and two men are standing by the pond with her,
CLINT and TJ. They're both wearing jeans with knives hitched
onto their belts, and there are bows and arrows in their I

dazzling sunlight, and there are punks and hippies and
tattoos everywhere. Cheryl doesn't look out of place, with
her tattoo and her caked—on dirt and her back-pack, but she
feels out of place. She sees Jerry Garcia's face and name
everywhere — on home—made signs in shop windows, on T-shirts,
stuck onto the sides of vans. She smiles and nods her head to
the rhythm of an acoustic guitarist playing the Grateful_

INT. MOTEL ROOM — DAY 148
Close on what could be a map: a ridged, pale, puckered,
otherworldly landscape. It's the skin on Cheryl's hips, where
the skin has been rubbed raw and healed itself ‘and rubbed
raw and healed itself until it resembles something that you
might find in an organic butcher's shop. Cheryl is wearing a
black bra and pants, and she's examining herself thoughtfully

bleached, beaten up, hairy. She shaves her legs. I

waiting for customers. _

Great!

OK. Let's see what we've got.
INT. CLUB — DUSK . 150
Cheryl is wearing make—up. She looks_good, but unfamiliar to
us. The club is full. Some of the people from the post office
and the plaza are among the crowd listening to an original
cover of “Ripple” by the Grateful Dead, performed by a solo
guitar player—singer. Cheryl loves the music — it's nearly as
important to her as food, and she's wolfing it.down... '
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Jonathan, Cheryl's new friend, suddenly appears with two
glasses of red wine. They listen to the music in silence,
watching the crowd of “Dead Heads” accompanying the singer,
some of them with their eyes filled with tears.
Chefyl notices that Jonathan is connecting with the crowd.
She waits for him to look at her and when he does, she loves
what she sees.

INT. CAR ~ NIGHT 152
Cheryl is in Jonathan's car. He's driving down dark country
roads outside Ashland. He's talking, a little nervously.
Lucinda Williams is playing on his tape—deck. ’
JONATHAN
I love where I live. But I'm worried that
girls think I'm taking them somewhere to
chop their heads off with an axe.
He turns down a bumpy track. '
_ CHERYL
It hadn't occurred to me, until you said
that just now.
JONATHAN
So why do you trust me?
He stops the car. They have arrived at a farm in the middle
of nowhere.
CHERYL
I guess...I don't know what the
statistics are, but it has to be a
minority of axe-murderers who are Lucinda
Williams fans. And you have kind eyes,
and you live in a tent on an organic

Darkness, and then Jonathan turns on the light, and we can
see his tent. It's enormous, and lovely. You can stand up in
it, there's electric lighting + lamps that look like candles
on cardboard dressers on either side of the double bed ~ and
a heater. There are even books on a little shelf.
Cheryl looks around admiringly.
CHERYL
Wow. This is fantastic.
JONATHAN

He looks at Cheryl.
JONATHAN (CONT’D)

He puts his arms around her and kisses her again. They fall

But if this goes any further..,do you
have a condom? '
Cheryl laughs.
CHERYL '
I've been carrying a condom in my pocket
for weeks, in case. When I looked at
myself in the mirror, I decided I wasn't
taking my pants off for anyone. So I left
it in the motel.
JONATHAN
That's cool.

It's raining hard, the light is fading, and Cheryl's cold and
wet and hurting. But she's approaching a rest stop ~ there's

CHERYL (CONT’D)
You know... problems don't stay problems.
They turn into something else. _

KYLE
What do they turn into?
CHERYL
I don't know yet.
KYLE
How did she die?
CHERYL
She got very sick.
KYLE
My mother is a singer. She has taught me
many songs. Would you like to hear one?
l CHERYL '
I certainly would.
Kyle sings Red River Valley — beautifully and with feeling.
The llama, the story—book grandmother, the strange boy, the
old song...It's an overwhelming moment for Cheryl, strange
and funny and beautiful. She's holding back tears.
EXT. TRAIL — DAY ' 175
Cheryl walking backwards up the trail, waving at Kyle and
Vera while they wave back. We still hear the voice of the kid
singing the song. Cheryl smiles to herself.
CHERYL (V.O.)
"I have some problems too. My mom died.”
Jesus. A five—year-old kid, stupid! I
really made his day.
She laughs, and then the laughter turns into something else,
and she begins to cry and cry and cry, for the first time on
the trail. - '
CHERYL (V.O.)
Mom, I'm not crying because of you. I'm
not crying because of dad, or because of
Paul. I'm not crying because I'm happy or
sad. I'm crying because I'm full. That
kid. This place. Hundreds of miles.
Ninety days on the trail, and all the
years before that. I'm full up.
She carries on crying.
CHERYL
I miss you!

EXT. TRAIL ~ DUSK A178
Cheryl is lying in her sleeping bag, on her tarp, out on the
open, by a reservoir. She didn't.put up her tent. A camp fire
is burning close to her. She's writing in her diary.
CHERYL (v.o.)
There's no way to know what makes one
thing happen and not another. What leads
to what. What destroys what. What causes
what to flourish or die or take another
course. .
Cheryl stops and looks at the fire. In it: what's left of THE
PACIFIC CREST TRAIL, VOLUME 1. I
EXT. TRAIL — DAWN 178
Cheryl asleep out in the open. She wakes up with a start and
looks down her body: hundreds of tiny little black frogs are
hopping all over her sleeping bag. She shrieks soundlessly,
laughs, stands up.
EXT. TRAIL — DAY B178
CARD ON SCREEN — DAY 94
Cheryl back on the trail. She stops to fill her hat full of
the large, ripe berries that overhang the trail, eating some
as she does so.
- CHERYL (v.o.)
It took me years to be the woman my
mother raised.

180 EXT. TOLLBOOTH — DAY
WILD Pink (10/09/13) 111.
9 EXT. TRAIL - DAY ‘ 179
Cheryl rounds a bend and sees something. She stops. Simon and
Garfunkel's El Condor Pasa starts to play.
CHERYL (V.O.)
It took me four years, seven months, and
three days to do it, without her. I
didn't know where I was going until I got
there.
She starts to Walk again towards something we can hardly see
through the trees: a bridge.
_ ' 180
The tollbooth agent waves Cheryl through. A sign above the
tollbooth says ‘Bridge Of The Gods’. She starts her walk
across the bridge.
CHERYL (v.o.)
I felt more alone than anyone in the
whole wide world that morning. Maybe that
was okay.
We follow her. She stops next to the structure. Her POV —
Beneath her on the road, people walking. They spot her, smile
and wave. They turn to look at her. The sun is reflecting off
the beautiful blue water. She can see fish swimming in the
river. She looks up at the blue sky, closes her eyes.
CHERYL (v.o.)
I didn't need to reach with my bare hands
anymore. To know that seeing the fish-
beneath the surface of the water was
enough. That it was everything... my
life, like all lives, mysterious, I
irrevocable and sacred. So very close, so
very present, so very belonging to me.
She opens her eyes, and sees a fox sat in the middle of the
I road, on the other side of the bridge. He looks at her for a
1‘
I moment... and leaves. _
CHERYL (v.o.)
How wild it was, to let it be. »
Cheryl touches the bridge and smiles. Her eyes fill with
tears.
Simon and Garfunkel start to sing El Condor Pasa.
