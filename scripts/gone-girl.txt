Based on the Novel By

 Al BLACK SCREEN Al
FADE IN:
NICK (V.0.)
When I think of my wife, I always
think of her head.
INT. BEDROOM - SOMETIME
We see the back of AMY DUNNE’S HEAD, resting on a pillow.
NICK (V.0.)
I picture cracking her lovely
skull, unspooling her brain, Nick runs his fingers into Amy’s hair.
NICK (V.0.) Trying to get answers.
He twirls and twirls a lock, a screw tightening.
NICK (V.0.)
The primal questions of a marriage:
What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?
AMY wakes, turns, gives a look of alarm. BLACK SCREEN
2 EXT. NORTH CARTHAGE - MORNING 2
A carved faux-marble entry—reading FOREST GLEN—ushers us into a ruined HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. Mostly VACANT houses. A few Fourth of July decorations hang in windows. A weird, BUCOLIC air: swaying grasses, stray wildlife.
*
3 EXT. NICK DUNNE’S FRONT YARD - DAWN 3 *
TITLE CARD: JULY 5th, 2012 THE MORNING OF
NICK DUNNE, 30s, handsome, is taking out the trash; his yard * is the only one mowed—all around him WILDERNESS encroaches.
The SUN rises over the treeline and blares its FIRST-DEGREE SPOTLIGHT in his face. He looks ILL.

He turns and stares back at his HOUSE as if girding himself. He strides across the yard, opens the door. His shadowy figure fills the doorway for a moment. He SHUTS the door.
EXT. BAR PARKING LOT - DAY

She places
GO (sweet• smile)
Master Mind! I hated this game!
NICK You loved it.
GO
You loved it. Thanks.
it behind the bar alongside SORRY!, CLUE, LIFE.
NICK * Pour me a bourbon, would ya?
pointedly at the clock: 11:09 a.m. She pours two *
GO glances
bourbons. Settles in.
GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 2.
NICK—wearing noticeably different clothes—arrives under a
glaring SUN. Down the street, a troupe of HOMELESS MEN walks * single file along the river.
INT. THE BAR - DAY 5
Nick’s twin sister, GO, 30s, nerdy-hot, is washing mugs. The bar is packed with ‘80s k±tsch: board games, toys, posters. Their very own CLUBHOUSE.
GO
Ah, the Irish prince graces us with
his presence.
He sits on the bar’s customer side. She flicks suds at him. *
NICK
Brought you a present.
He sets a decrepit ‘70s—era Master Mind on the bar.
GO
What’s up, Jitters?
He shrugs. She tries to wait him out. Fails.
*
 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13

GO (CONT’D)
If you don’t talk, I’ll fill the
silence with: an Excruciating Story by Margo Dunne.
He smiles. This is an old, reliable routine.
GO (CONT’D)
I could tell you about my customer—
service experience while changing Internet providers.
NICK
I do like that one.
GO
Or the time I saw a woman who
looked exactly like my friend Monica but it wasn’t Monica, it was a stranger—
NICK
—whose name was.. .Monica.
GO
Made it kind of interesting.
She gives a look: Talk.
NICK It’s a bad day.
GO
Amy?
NICK
Our anniversary. Five.
GO
Five?! That came fast.
NICK And furious.
6 INT. SOMEWHERE - SOMETIME
*
CLOSEUP on a PEN, cursiving across a DIARY. The pen is GIRLY, topped with pink feathers. We see at the top: January 8,
2005. We hear the words as we see them written in pink.
AMY (V.0.)
I’m so crazy, stupid happy.

INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT
AMY ELLIOTT, early 30s, gorgeous, is in a crowded hipster party. Dude-heavy. She weaves her way through the guys.
AMY (V.0.) I met a boy.
7
GG - Yellow Revisions 9/27/13 4.
She spots her FRIEND deep-flirting a guy, and stops midway, stuck with TWO BEERS. She makes her way toward a table with picked—over food and scans the room for anyone she knows. She spots NICK DUNNE—he spots her.
AMY (V.0.)
A great, gorgeous, sweet, cool-ass
guy.
Nick weaves his way over. She’s setting down her beer.
NICK
It’s dangerous to set down a monk— * brewed Belgian wheat beer when the * party is down to three Beast Lites
and a bottle of Pucker.
AMY
Might attract some desperate
characters.
He gestures toward a group of Williamsburg musician-types: suspenders and broad-brimmed hats.
NICK
Things could get ugly. The Amish
are on Ruinspringa.
AMY
They already relieved me of my
artisanal meat platter.
NICK
Finally, someone to tell me how to
pronounce that word. AMY
Meat?
NICK One syllable.
He picks up the beer.
 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13
5.
NICK (CONT’D) Whose beer am I drinking?
(moving closer to her, so they have same POV)
What’s your type?
* * * * *
They scan the crowd together. Cozy. Nick points to a horn- rimmed, haughty DOUCHEBAG. *
NICK (CONT’D) * I can’t picture you sitting still * while he bloviates about his post- * grad thesis on Proust. *
Nick points to a sideburned guy in a NOVELTY TEE. *
NICK (CONT’D) * Ironic hipster so self—aware he * makes everything a joke? *
AMY * I prefer men who are funny, not * ‘~funny.” *
Nick points to a wavy-haired granola-yoga type. *
NICK
Please tell me it’s not Deeply
Sensitive Emo-Dude
—who says things like “I love strong women.”
NICK
Code for ‘~I hate strong women.”
A beat as they scan the room, then face each other. *
AMY * And what type are you? *
NICK
Corn-fed, salt-of the earth * Missouri guy.
AMY Missouri?! How cute.
NICK
Ah: native New Yorker!
 GG — Yellow Revisions 9/27/13

AMY
World ends at the Hudson. I’m l~my.
NICK
So tell me, Amy. Who are you?
AMY
A. I am an award—winning
scrimshander. B. I am a moderately influential warlord. C. I write personality quizzes for magazines.
NICK (taking her hand)
A. Your fingers are far too delicate for real scrimshaw work. B. I am a charter subscriber to Middling Warlord Weekly—I’m sure I’d recognize you. So: C.
AMY
And you? Who are you?
NICK
I’m the guy to save you from all
this awesomeness.
8 INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - NIGHT
They head down: tipsy, not touching, but thinking about it.
AMY
So if you write for a men’s
magazine, does that make you an expert on being a man?
NICK
In theory, I know what men drink,
what men wear-
AMY How men bullshit.
NICK Not with you.
Amy laughs: ha, ha.
NICK (CONT’D) I’m serious.
She stops, studies him.

NICK (CONT’D)
Hold on.
Nick brushes her lips clean. They kiss.
INT. NICK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 10
A SHABBY, CRAMPED garden studio apartment. BARS on the
windows. NICK and AMY are in bed: blissful. Outside, a car’s * headlights flash: Their sugary prints light up the headboard. *
GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13
7.
AMY
It’s hard to believe you. I think
it’s your chin. NICK
My chin?
AMY
It’s quite villainous.
She places a finger over his chin. Tests the view.
NICK
No bulishit. 100% truth.
EXT. BROOKLYN - NIGHT
They are huddling together, walking to hail a cab.
NICK
I love New York parties because I
get to leave and walk out into New York. The Great What Next?
*
They turn the corner and step into a cloud of powdered sugar as it’s funneled into a bakery. A SUGAR SNOWSTORM. Nick grins: Like this!
NICK (CONT’D)
You know I have to kiss you now.
AMY Is that right?
NICK
I would be a fool to let you walk

AMY
Nick Dunne. I really like you.
11 INT. THE BAR - DAY
The Master Mind sits untouched as GO sets up LIFE.
GO
So is Amy going to do one of her
anniversary—whaddaya call it?— treasure hunts?
NICK
You mean the forced march designed
to point out what an uncaring, oblivious asshole I am.
GO
Wow.
Silence. Nick stares at the LIFE board.
NICK
LIFE. I don’t remember the point.
GO
Deep Hasbro thoughts. Spin. What
was the clue last year she got so mad about?
NICK (reciting)
~‘When your poor Amy has a cold; this dessert just must be sold.”
GO The answer?
NICK
I don’t know, Gol
NICK spins, moves his man, lands on Get Married.
GO
Few years ago—you’d have known.
GO places a pink peg-wife in his car. He glares at it.
NICK
Few years ago it was fun. Year One,
the traditional gift is paper—so at the end, she gave me a bound notebook.

 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13

NICK (CONT’D)
So I could write my novel.
GO
What’d you give her?
NICK
A kite. She’d never flown a kite.
Go spins; skips over the Get Married space.
NICK (CONT’D)
Year Four: flowers. She led me to
the dying rosebush in our backyard.
GO
The one you never watered. . . so
symbolic. What’s the gift for five? NICK
Wood.
GO
What’d you get her?
NICK
There’s no good gift for wood.
GO
Go home, fuck her brains out, then
smack her with your penis: Some wood for you, bitch!
They laugh. Interrupted by the phone. Go answers.
GO (CONT’D) The Bar.. .Yep, hold on.
(hand over mouthpiece) It’s Watchful Wally!
NICK
Bet my gutters need snaking.
(picking up phone)
Hey, Walter. What’s up?.. .Ohl that is weird. OK, thanks.
(to Go) Bleecker’ s outside.
GO
You are way too into that cat.

EXT. DUNNE HOUSE - DAY
12
GG - Blue Draft — 8/29/13 10.
NICK pulls up, salutes WALTER, who’s on his front porch behind a WALKER. WALTER gives a curt nod. BLEECKER is sitting on the Dunne stairs. Nick scoops him up, heads to the FRONT DOOR, which is GAPING WIDE OPEN. Nick stops in his tracks.
INT. DUNNE HOUSE - DAY 13 NICK doesn’t close the door. He sets the cat down.
NICK
Amy?
We follow Nick as he heads up the stairs.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 14
Neat. Empty. An iron sits on an ironing board, pretty DRESS next to it. No Amy.
INT. HALLWAY - UPSTAIRS ROOMS - DAY 15
Nick proceeds—quickly—down the hallway, peering into doors: An OFFICE (his, a disaster); an elaborately pillowed GUEST ROOM, and one room that contains only a LITTER BOX. Nick goes back downstairs, into:
INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
Two placemats on the shiny table.
INT. OFFICE - DAY
Amy’s office. Neat as a pin. Empty.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Nick runs back through the DINING ROOM, into the:

Nick stops short. The carpet is covered with GLASS SHARDS from the overturned coffee table. END TABLES are SMASHED; an OTTOMAN is UPSIDE DOWN. NICK backs up.
EXT. WALTER’S FRONT PORCH - DAY 20
Walter looks up from his paper as he hears, from across the street:
NICK (O.S.)
Amy!
INT. DUNNE HOUSE - DAY 21 DOOR opens on RHONDA BONEY, 40s, and JIM GILPIN, 20s.
BONEY
Mr. Dunne? I’m Detective Rhonda
Boney and this is Officer James Gilpin. We understand there are concerns about your wife?
Nick walks them in, shows them the scene.
NICK
My wife is gone. I came home to
this.
They bend down, examine the scene. Hard to read if they’re impressed or not. BONEY takes a YELLOW POST-IT and places it on the MANTEL below three upright photo FRAMES.
NICK (CONT’D)
I’m not someone who hits the panic
button, but-It’s weird, right?
BONEY
You mind if we look around?
INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
They speak in time to the stair steps.
BONEY
How long you two been here?
NICK
Two years, September. We used to
live in New York.
*

 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 GILPIN
City?
NICK
I was a writer. We were writers.
BONEY
Why’d y’all come back here?
NICK My mom got sick.
BONEY
I’m sorry, how is she?
NICK She’s dead.
12.
23 INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Boney reaches the landing, eyes Nick like a patient mom.
BONEY I’m so sorry.
They start down the hail.
BONEY (CONT’D)
So what do you do now? For work.
NICK
Now I own The Bar, downtown. With
my twin sister, Margo.
BONEY
The Bar! Love the name. Very meta.
23
24 INT. BEDROOM - DAY 24 Boney tests the IRON. Hot. Unplugs it. Looks at the dress.
BONEY
Pretty dress. Date night?
NICK
It’s our anniversary.
BONEY sticks another POST-IT on the IRONING BOARD.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

BONEY
Wow. Impressive gal.
One small corner is dedicated to a kids’ book series, AMAZING AMY. Photos of Amy, at all ages, with her parents, REND and MARYBETH, in front of posters for the books.
NICK
So should I be con(cerned)—
BONEY (studying a picture)
I remember these books.
CLOSEUP of a dual frame: AMAZING AMY, the iconic cartoon drawing, is grinning from one side. Our real AMY ELLIOTT DUNNE is mimicking the same grin on the other side.
BONEY (CONT’D)
I remember these! Wait. Your wife
is Amazing Amy?
INT. SOMEWHERE - SOMETIME 27
CLOSEUP of a DIARY, a PEN—advertising AMAZING AMY—is cursiving across. The eraser topper is a BRIDE with VEIL. The date is February 24, 2007. We see the words as we hear:
28
AMY (V.0.)
Amazing Fucking Amy is getting
fucking married! That’s how the night started.
INT. UPSCALE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - NIGHT
28
GG — Blue Draft - 8/29/13 13.
Nick walks ahead with GILPIN as BONEY lingers: She sees on
the baseboard three SPLASHES of rusty RED. Looks more curious * than alarmed. A POST-IT down.
INT. AMY’S OFFICE - DAY 26
BONEY enters. Checks out Amy’s desk area. BONEY flips through * Amy’s well-tended desk calendar: “NICK: DENTIST” is set for March 2013. In July 2013 is “BLEECKER: SHOTS.” Amy’s degrees cover the walls: HARVARD undergrad, Masters in Psych. *
TINY book launch party. Posters advertise the AMAZING AMY book series—all 20. “Written by RAND and MARYBETH ELLIOTT—two psychologists—Who are parents JUST LIKE YOU!”
*
*
 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 14.
AMY (V.0.)
With me—regular, flawed, Real
Amy—jealous, as always, of the golden child. Perfect, brilliant Amazing Amy. Who is getting fucking married.
NICK and Amy are tight together. Waiters are circulating drinks, wearing T—shirts with an impish Amazing Amy and her TRADEMARK line: If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing BRIGHT!
NICK
Now you can say you came. And in 10
minutes we’ll leave.
AMY
Perfect, time for a quick tour of
my failings.
They walk along the wall of BOOK POSTERS. Stop in front of a poster of: gradeschool AMAZING AMY holding a CELLO. A MUTT * beside her.
AMY (CONT’D)
When I was 10 I quit cello. In the * next book, Amazing Amy became a
prodigy. *
Next POSTER: teen AMAZING AMY playing volleyball. *
NICK
You don’t play volleyball. *
AMY
I got cut freshman year. ~ made * varsity. *
They continue their tour.
NICK
And how long did you have a dog? *
AMY
~ got a dog. Puddles made her * more relatable. *
They stop in front of the biggest poster: Amazing Amy, in a * bridal veil, a BLAND GROOM next to her. The banner reads:
30th Anniversary Special Edition-AMAZING AMY AND THE BIG DAY.
NICK
I love your parents, but they can
be assholes.
 GG — Yellow Revisions 9/27/13 15.
In the center of the limp party, RAND and MARYBETH, 60s, cheerily hand out commemorative PENS-identical to the one Amy used for her DIARY. Rand spots them—hands them each a pen.
RAND (to Amy)
Hey, sweetheart, this is a big
night for your mom. It would mean so much to her if you’d talk to a few reporters. Bloggers. Give ‘em a little “Amy” color.
Painful pause.
RAND (CONT’D) People want to hear from you.
AMY
We can’t stay long-
RAND
Fantastic! Fifteen minutes, tops!
As Rand strides away, Nick gives Amy a look.
AMY
This is why I have my trust fund,
my Brooklyn brownstone. I can’t really complain.
NICK
Your parents plagiarized your
childhood.
AMY
No, they improved upon it, and then
peddled it to the masses. * Marybeth pops up, a little tipsy, hugs them.
MARYBE TH
I thought you were going to wear
white to match the wedding theme.
AMY
I thought that’d be embarrassing.
MARYBE TH (half joking)
If it’s worth doing
NICK
It’s worth doing. .how’s that go?
 29
BRIGHT! BRIGHT! The waiters are everywhere in the T-shirts.
NICK (CONT’D) Tip of my tongue...
MARYBETH
You’re very cute, Nick. Amy, you
know what would make Dad’s night-
AMY I’m on it.
(to Nick)
I love having strangers pick at my scabs.
INT. - BAR CORNER - NIGHT
Amy, standing at a cocktail table, deals with a montage of New York media types. NICK hovers nearby.
EARNEST GIRL
I’m curious whether it’s difficult
for you to watch Amazing Amy heading down the aisle
FASHIONISTA
-and this big party celebrating
this fictional wedding-
NERVOUS INTERN
Because my understanding is that
you are not married-
ABOVE-IT-ALL JOURNALIST
Correct?
AMY
Correct. Amazing Amy is always,
always one step ahead of me. Nick cuts in, blocks the journalist.
NICK
I have a few questions.
AMY Ah, it’s you.
NICK
I am here in a strictly

He elaborately sets out pad, pen. AMY prepares to be amused.

 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13
17.
NICK (CONT’D)
Amy, you’ve had the pleasure of
dating Nick Dunne for how long?
AMY
Two magical years.
NICK
Is it true that during the course
of your relationship, you have performed such gracious gestures as
(checking notes)
not correcting Nick when he
pronounced quinoa as kw±n—o—a.
AMY
An understandable mistake.
NICK
He also thought it was a fish.
AMY
He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.
NICK
Touché.
AMY
I think it’s pronounced tow—chay.
NICK (laughing)
You also manage to appear surprised and delighted when Nick’s elderly mother breaks into “New York, New York” every.. .time.. . she sees you.
AMY (crooning)
These bag of bone shoes...
NICK
You also bought Nick his first pair
of scissors, correct?
AMY
And matching stapler.
NICK
Amy Elliott, you are beyond
amazing. You are incredibly smart but entirely unsnobby. You are kind but never a martyr. You surprise me. You challenge me.

NICK (CONTD)
And—fun fact for our readers—you
have a world—class vagina. ~my chokes on her drink.
NICK (CONT’D)
However my colleagues inform me
that as yet you are not married. AMY
I am not.
NICK
Isn’t it time we fixed that?
AMY (V.0.)
Then the night wasn’t so bad
anymore.
INT. POLICE STATION BULLPEN - DAY
GILPIN is watching NICK from the other side of the glass. NICK’s fiddling with his smartphone. HONEY enters.
BONEY How’s our boy?
GILPIN
He’s just fucking with his phone.
Playing, like, Tetris. They watch NICK a few more seconds.
BONEY
I remember him, you know? From when
he was little. Cute kid. Straight out of a cereal commercial.
Gilpin gives a bored grunt: he couldn’t •care less.
BONEY (CONT’D)
Gil? If this girl doesn’t show
up.. .this could get out of hand.
GILPIN Because of those books?
HONEY
Your wife likes those tabloid crime
shows, right?
GILPIN She’s an addict.

OK, so: Beautiful wife, handsome
husband
GILPIN
Wife goes missing on her
anniversary—
BONEY
—turns out she’s the star of a book
series every woman in the country read as a kid.
GILPIN
Shit.
BONEY
We are the cops of a suburb of a
suburb. Let’s stay on our toes.
31 INT. POLICE STATION BULLPEN - DAY
31 *
BONEY, GILPIN and STEVE the TECH enter. STEVE is brandishing a packet of wrapped Q-tips and his GSR kit.
BONEY
Nick, this is Steve Eckert. He’s
going to take a swab of your cheek and a hand swipe if that’s ok.
NICK This is for?
GILPIN Gunshot residue, DNA.
BONEY
Just so we can say we did. OK?
NICK
OK.
Steve is in and out with no eye contact.
BONEY
And now it’s done. Crossed off the
list.
Steve leaves. Nick watches his samples going out the door.
 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 20.
BONEY (CONT’D)
Now, normally, we wouldn’t treat
this as a missing persons case so quick. We’d tell you to call back in 24 hours. But given the scene in the house and given our spike in violent crime of late, we’re going to take this very, very seriously.
NICK
OK. Good.
BONEY
So: We got forensics over at your
place. You got somewhere to stay?
NICK My sister’s.
BONEY
Good. We’re tracking Amy’s phone,
credit cards. We’ll organize searches, put up flyers. We’ll hold a press conference tomorrow.
NICK
A press conference?!
BONEY
Want to get the word out, right?
An officer comes in with two styrofoam cups of coffee, slaps a manila envelope on the table. NICK smiles. BONEY frowns.
NICK
Sorry. I felt like I was in a Law
and Order episode for a second. Bum— * BUM. *
BONEY
You’re not, unfortunately. *
She stares at NICK, aggressively PONDERING.
BONEY (CONT’D)
Now, time is of the essence in
these cases. That said, if you want
to call a lawyer... *
NICK
No, no, whatever you need.
 GG — Yellow Revisions 9/27/13 21.
BONEY
OK, so you and ~my have been here
two years. You tend bar.
NICK
I own The Bar. I also teach a
creative-writing class at MVCC. BONEY
No kids?
No kids.
NICK
BONEY
So what does ~my do, most days?
Woman with all those degrees, what does she do?
NICK She stays busy.
BONEY Doing what?
Nick attempts a mental inventory. Fails.
NICK She’s a big reader.
This lands as lamely as it sounds—and everyone notes it.
BONEY
Days can get long. I know a few
housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon. Or prescription pills
GILPIN
Just last week: soccer mom, nice
lady, got her teeth kicked in over * some Oxycontin.
BONEY
Ever since the mall went bust, half
the town out of work. . .we can’t keep up with the drug problem.
NICK
I’m sure that’s not it.
BONEY
Amy got friends we can talk to?
 GG - Yellow Revisions 9/27/13
22.
NICK Not really. No.
BONEY
No friends. In this whole town.
NICK
She was friendly with my mom...
(pause)
We’ve had a problem with the homeless in our neighborhood—
GILPIN We’ll look into it.
BONEY
So you got to The Bar around eleven
today. Where were you before then? Just to cross that off.
NICK
Well, I was at home until 9 or so.
Then I was at Sawyer Beach. Had my coffee, read the paper.
BONEY
You visit with anyone there?
NICK
I go there for the quiet.
Nick picks off pieces of his Styrofoam cup; it squeaks.
BONEY
So your wife has no friends here.
Is she kinda. . .stand-offish?.. .Ivy League?
Nick is visibly uncomfortable. He squeaks at the styrofoam.
BONEY (CONT’D) Rub people the wrong way?
NICK
Well, she’s complicated. She has
high expectations.
Boney puts her hand on his to get him to stop the squeaking.
BONEY
Type A. That can drive you crazy if
you’re not like that. You seem laid back. Type B. Speaking of which: ~my’s blood type?
*

GG - Yellow Revisions 9/27/13

NICK Don’t know.
BONEY
You don’t know if she has friends,
you don’t know how she spends her days, you don’t know her blood type?
GILPIN
Sure you guys are married?
NICK
Maybe 0?
BONEY
Her folks still in New York?
NICK
Yes.
BONEY
Can they get here in time for the
press conference tomorrow?
NICK
I haven’t called them yet.
BONEY
You haven’t called your wife’s
parents?
NICK
I’ve been talking with you~
BONEY
Call them please, Nick. Now.
NICK leaves—BONEY cocks an eyebrow at GILPIN. Door shuts.
GILPIN
Should I know my wife’s blood type?
INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY

Nick on a wall phone, pacing on the short leash of the cord. We hear MARYBETH’s TONE on the other end: FEMALE; ANGRY.
NICK
I’m so sorry, Marybeth. I just kept
hoping she’d walk back in the door.
 GG - Yellow Revisions 9/27/13 24.
MARYBETH

Played.. .tennis.. .on a plane now-
NICK
We’re still not sure what we’re
dealing with. The cops have been through the house and I’ve been at the station and we decided. . . at this point they’re taking it very seriously. And so I’m calling you.
MARYBETH (a few words)

Nick and the Elliotts pause for a few photos. The Elliotts look devastated; NICK looks annoyed. A PHOTOG asks Nick to pose next to Amy’s photo: a demented PROM SHOT. SNAP!
NICK looks more annoyed. He glances at GO; she prods him to SMILE. NICK flashes a sudden, smarmy SMILE, overly charming and oily. The CAMERAS click crazily. SNAP! SNAP! He drops it.

BONEY, RAND AND MARYBETH and NICK are at a conference table. Boney is taking notes. The Elliotts have their two suitcases with them. They open one: It’s filled with “AMY FILES”: Photo albums, news clippings, Amazing Amy books.

little girl, hopping out of an SUV. The child drags it through a busy parking lot: Two newsvans, SUV5, station wagons. Women pile out. A strangely festive air: Many wearing red white and blue of the 4th of JULY weekend.

INT. DRURY LODGE BALLROOM - MORNING

GG - Yellow Revisions 9/27/13 45A.
Volunteers transform the dingy ballroom into the Find Amy headquarters. PHONE BANKS plugged in; a GIANT AMY HEADSHOT is hung; DONUTS. A few PHOTOGRAPHERS take shots. It feels like the desperate campaign headquarters of a losing politician.
NICK enters, and FRIENDS and NEIGHBORS rush to WELCOME him. He makes old women blush; he charms the bashful kids of old girlfriends. Lots of hugs. A group of overtanned FORTYSONETHINGS eye NICK, whispering like girls—their leader, SHAWNA, catches NICK’s eye. NICK smiles, politely. From across the room, GO sees all this and rolls her eyes: Same as always. MARYBETH sees this and IT IS NOTED.
NICK extricates himself and spots BONEY heading to him. He passes DESI COLLINGS, all grown up (and unrecognized). DESI is protectively holding a handful of FLIERS with Amy’s PHOTO. The two exchange a glance as they pass each other.

NICK (eyeing DESI)
You know that guy?
BONEY
Don’t worry, we videotape everyone
who comes in or out of these things. You tend to get a lot of-
NICK Do—gooders?
BONEY
Freaks. Hey, meant to ask you:
Noelle Hawthorne? NICK shrugs: Who?
BONEY (CONT’D)
Lives on your street? Amy’s best
friend.
NICK
I have never heard the name Noelle
Hawthorne.
BONEY
She and her husband have triplets?
NICK
OhI Right. No. Best friend? Amy
doesn’t even know her. I mean, to wave hi, but.. .no.
At the snack table, a HOMELESS GUY is stealing food. NICK excuses himself to have words with him as GILPIN sidles up.
BONEY
He acted like Noelle was a complete
stranger.
GILPIN Of course he did.
NICK hands the homeless guy a bag of bagels to go.
GILPIN CONT’D)
Oh, look, he’s being a good guy so
we can all see him be a good guy.
BONEY
You really don’t like him.

GILP IN What’s to like?
Volunteers are dispersing to search sites. Each VOLUNTEER is holding a colored piece of paper with the name of a site on it: FOREST GLEN. RIVERWALK. NICK spots MARYBETH and RAND leaving and is about to head over when he gets another glimpse of DESI—the two lock eyes.
NICK can’t quite place him, but DESI starts moving, and NICK follows, weaving through the crowd. Exits into:
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 74
The hallway is VACANT. Nick’s DISPOSABLE begins buzzing. He ducks farther down the hall. NICK is picking up just as: SHAWNA peers around the corner. Nick abruptly ends the call.
SHAWNA
Nick? I just wanted to introduce
myself. My name’s Shawna Kelly.
Nick nods: thanks. He’s seething at the interruption.
SHAWNA (CONT’D)
I’m so sorry for your.. .troubles.
NICK That’s very kind.
He gives her an after—you gesture but she doesn’t budge.
SHAWNA
Are you remembering to eat?
NICK Lotta cold cuts.
Again: After you.
SHAWNA
I’m going to fix you up my world
famous Chicken Frito Pie.
NICK
That’s very sweet of you and very
unnecessary.
He tries again to get past her. He pats her on the arm as a goodbye, she puts her hand on top of his.
GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 47.
 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 48.
SHAWNA
You have to keep up your strength.
She digs through her handbag, grabs a cell. Jams her face against his.
SHAWNA (CONT’D) Say: Chicken frito pie!
NICK—just wanting to leave—reflexively grins. CLICK. She shows him the photo: The two of them, cheek to cheek, Shawna’s glossed lips pouty. Without context (and even with), the photo is wildly inappropriate, a little sleazy.
NICK
Oh. You know what? That’s-please
delete that would you?
SHAWNA It’s a nice photo.
NICK
It’s just not appropriate. Do me * the favor, would you?
SHAWNA debates.
NICK (CONT’D) * I’m asking you nicely: Please * delete that photo. *
NICK tries to lean past her and hit delete. She holds the * cell away from him—hey!—he tries to grab it.
SHAWNA
What is wrong with you?
NICK grabs her arm. It’s the first time he seems dangerous.
NICK
You can’t share that with anyone.
SHAWNA
I’ll share it with anyone I like.
SHAWNA scrambles past him, shoots down the hall to the elevator.
SHAWNA (CONT’D)
Asshole.
NICK rests his head against the wall. Breathes.

EXT. SAWYER BEACH - DAY 76
A small, disgusting sandbar: overflowing trash bins, dirty diapers, a bench covered in obscene graffiti. Volunteers are fanning along the river, searching. A SEARCH DOG is sniffing ANY’s DRESS. NICK walks with MARYBETH.
MARYBETH
It’s like you’re the goddam
Homecoming King.
NICK
My mom. . .it was a big deal to her.
That I be polite. Courteous. A gentleman.
MARYBETH
It looked like you were having fun.
NICK
Marybeth, I’m in a nightmare here.
I’m just trying to be nice to the people who are trying to find Amy.
MARYBETH
I’m sorry, you’re right.
She tapes a flier to a tree. Sniffs. Looks down.
MARYBETH (CONT’D)
God, this place literally smells
like feces. You really came here * the morning of your anniversary?
NICK
That’s why I come here. Because no

They drink in silence. Go examines the hand—crocheted yarn cozie on her beer.
GO (CONT’D)
You know what I keep thinking?
NICK

GO

Go swallows her beer. Nick clearly doesn’t want to talk.

I feel like I could disappear.
INT. GO’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 86
NICK is asleep on the couch. The TV flickers on an old ‘60s detective show. Just inside his bag, his DISPOSABLE buzzes.
INSERT on DISPLAY: im outside open up.
BUZZ. Nick wakes. BUZZ. Reads. Jumps up. FLINGS the FRONT door open. Just a quiet, dark street. He runs to the BACK DOOR, FLINGS it OPEN: There is ANDIE, 20, a cheerful fuckdoll of a girl. AMY’s beautiful; ANDIE’s hot. NICK yanks her in.
NICK Andie, shit!
ANDIE
I saw you on TV. It’s so insane.

ANDIE Rehearsals.
NICK (absolutely baffled)
* * *

What?
Godspell!
ANDIE
Nick can’t believe it. He collapses on the couch. Andie sits next to him. She cuddles into him. Nuzzles his cheek.
NICK
My sister’s asleep. You really
shouldn’t be here, Aridie.
AND IE
I needed to see you.
They kiss; she wraps herself around him. Nick pulls away. She kisses him again. He pulls away.
ANDIE (CONT’D)
Can you at least say you love me?
NICK
I love you. But, sweetheart, we
have to be real careful right now. She pulls him toward her.
ANDIE
I’ve been so scared.
NICK Between rehearsals.
AND IE
You told me I needed to have my own
life.
She places his arms around her. Whispers in his ear.
ANDIE (CONT’D)
I need you. Now. Touch me.
 GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 55.
She kisses him again. Soon they’re tugging at each other’s clothes. She is unbuttoning his pants when NICK rears away. She tries to pull him back. He un-hooks her hands from him.
NICK
I can’t. I can’t. It’s not smart.
Andie rehooks her arms around him. She’s invading him like IVY. Nick’s not entirely resisting.
NICK (CONT’D)
You haven’t told anyone about us,
have you? Texting, facebook. Anything that might be...
ANDIE (pouting)
You buy my presents in cash. You talk to me on a disposable phone. Now you grill me like I’m a criminal. I’m your girlfriend.
NICK
Did you leave a pair of red panties
in my office? Lacy?
ANDIE
I don’t know. Maybe.
(teasing)
They better be mine.
NICK
Think.
ANDIE
I don’t know. I’ll have to check my
red-panty inventory.
NICK
Baby, I need you to take this
seriously. And this is the last time we can see each other until...
Andie is on top of him but now pauses in her invasion.

He grabs her by both arms.
NICK
Never say that out loud again.
She stares at his hands until he removes them. Then she takes them and places them back on her. She begins moving his arms like a puppet, from her waist, up to her breasts. She presses her cheek against his so she can whisper.
ANDIE
I don’t want to fight. I just want
to be with you. That’s all I want.
She begins kissing him. Then she reclines, still holding his hands on her. She pulls down the top of her sundress, yanks the bottom hem up over her (red) panties, arranges herself like a (soft) porn star. Tugs at his pants.
ANDIE (CONT’D)
The last time you’ll see me. Make
the most of it.

Shit. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
He sits beside her, holds her in his arms.

TANNER
Thank you, Ellen, as always, for

AMY (V.0.)

BONEY
We’re not going to arrest anybody
just ‘cause Ellen Abbott says so.
GILPIN
Why are you so easy on him? You got
a crush?
BONEY

GILPIN (sulky)
No drug angle has panned out. Cross that off the list. I talked to the nurses who care for Nick’s dad. Guy’s a bastard but he’s weak as a kitten. Cross that off the list.
Donnelly starts a VIDEO: It’s NICK’s KITCHEN, in dark. * SLOWLY, the area begins glowing like a neon Jackson Pollock: * Wild sprays of blood all over the wall.
DONNELLY
The Luminol lit up the kitchen like
the Fourth of July. The blood is profuse and it is Amy’s type. B. We’ll have DNA soon.
BONEY Thoughts on a weapon?
DONNELLY (pointing on his photo)
The trajectory indicates blunt force. Probably not a baseball bat. A club, a 2 by 4.
THE VIDEO pans to the FLOOR: we can see a handprint that is * smeared along the floor, as if the owner were being dragged.
DONNELLY (CONT’D)
She fell here. I doubt she got back
up.

The park glows under camera lights. JOURNALISTS practice live shots. The LOCAL newsvans are joined by a HALF DOZEN REGIONAL—Arkansas, Tennessee, Illinois—and a few CABLE. NICK is besieged by reporters all the way to the platform. RAND and MARYBETH give him cool, for-the-camera hugs.
BONEY is scanning the crowd, GILPIN with her. Hundreds of CANDLES. GO enters. Gets a CANDLE. She and Nick catch each other’s eye. NICK gives a huge, relieved smile. She returns it, at a slightly lower volume. NICK is ushered to the mike.
NICK
My wife, Amy Elliott Dunne, has
been missing now for three days. I beg anyone who has any information to help us.
AMY stares at NICK from a 100 FIND AMY T-shirts.
NICK (CONT’D)
I want to thank you all for giving
me the opportunity to speak with
you tonight in my hometown. Let me
first say this: I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.
I am cooperating fully with the
police. I have never hired a
lawyer. I have nothing to hide. * Some so—called journalists
—especially a certain Southern
belle who shall remain
nameless—have taken up a lot of TV
hours talking about me. Tonight? I
think it’s time we talk about my
wife.
A scan of the crowd, dipping in on conversations: FRIEND ONE
He’s hot.
FRIEND TWO He’s creepy.
NICK (0.S.)
Amy is my soul mate. She is sweet,
charming and wise. I love you, Amy...
Scanning the crowd, NICK suddenly meets eyes with ANDIE, as:

NICK
I love my wife. I may not always
perform for the cameras. I may be punished for that. That’s fine. But I ask the media: Harass me, but don’t harass the people of this town.

A few claps. NOELLE HAWTHORNE, visibly pregnant, ANGRY,
begins cutting through the CANDLE-LIT crowd, towing TRIPLETS. *
NOELLE * Nick! *
NICK
Mock me, but please don’t make a * circus of this investigation. *
NOELLE is moving quickly. A lot of CLAPPING. Noelle, furious, stops trying to reach the stage and just digs in and hollers.
NOELLE
Where’s your wife, Nick!?
NICK
Let the police do their jobs.
NOELLE
What did you do to your pregnant
wife?!
The cameras and crowds are off NICK and on to NOELLE.
NICK
Let’s find... *
NOELLE * Did you tell them that, Nick? Did
you tell them Amy was six weeks * pregnant! *
Pregnant pregnant pregnant echoes across the park. NICK is trapped in the flash of a hundred bulbs. JOURNALISTS begin screaming: NICK, was AMY pregnant? NICK is this true? GO stands stunned, melting wax dripping from her candle. ANDIE runs away in tears. PANDEMONIUM. TOTAL CHAOS. BONEY and GILPIN usher NICK into a SQUAD CAR, fending off the push of the media. BONEY signals the driver: Go, go, go!

NICK opens the door pre-doorbell: ushers in BONEY and GILPIN. The JOURNOS go wild. DOOR SHUT.
BONEY (CONT’D) * Did you know your wife was * pregnant? *
NICK
Noelle Hawthorne is crazy! She * doesn’t even know Amy!
Boney ushers him to the table. Boney sprays a dozen photos across it: AMY and NOELLE. All seasons—almost a YEAR’s worth.
BONEY
They look like pretty good friends * tome. *
Nick examines the photos: a BEAMING, CHEERFUL AMY. *
NICK
(still staring at photos)
She’s not pregnant.
BONEY
We have her medical records
coming.. .So let’s talk. While we * wait. We’ll start with...

GILPIN
Dozens and dozens and dozens.
BONEY
This area? Looked wrong. From the

BONEY (CONT’D) Yet they remained upright
throughout a life and death struggle?
NICK
What do you want me to say...
GILPIN
You do any housekeeping the day
your wife went missing? NICK
No.
BONEY
OK, because our guys did a Luminol
test, and I’m sorry to tell you, the kitchen lit up. ~iny lost a lot of blood there. A lot.
NICK Oh my god.
BONEY
And then someone mopped it up.
NICK
Wait. If someone were staging a
crime scene, why mop up blood?
BONEY (too patiently)
No blood and no body suggests kidnapping-which tells us to look at people outside the house.
GILPIN
Like the homeless you keep
mentioning.
BONEY
A pooi of blood and no body
suggests homicide. Which tells us to look at people inside the house. Which is what we’re doing here.
A beat. NICK tries to keep his cool.

So. How was your marriage, Nick? Right now, all we got is Noelle.

GILPIN Money. Lack thereof.

Me and my ex, same. I mention it
because we’ve had a look at your finances, Nick. Phew!
She scatters a dozen CREDIT CARD BILLS across the table: all with NICK’s NAME, all marked LATE. PAY NOW.
BONEY (CONT’D)
One hundred and seventeen thousand

She sets out print-outs of ONLINE purchase pages: the TV, GOLF CLUBS Boney was asking about in inventory. Also a ROBOT DOG, and a FENDER ELECTRIC GUITAR.
NICK
Jesus! This is identity theft or
something! These cards aren’t mine. I mean: I don’t even golf!

I wanted a baby with Amy! Amy. A

“When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessert just must be-” This is the clue you couldn’t solve, right?

anything for her. It’s fucking wrong.

Let me tell you what she told me.
She told me you unraveled after she dumped you. You stalked her. Threatened her. And finally you attempted suicide on her bed in her dorm room. Had to be sent away.

She does the treasure hunt.
NICK
The key is the treasure hunt: Amy
was taking me on a tour of my infidelities—and rubbing my nose in them. Clue One she leaves for the cops to find. It leads us to my office—a place where I had sex with
Andie. And what do we find there, but a pair of women’s underwear—

Took me to the woodshed. Where we- *
GO God, Nick!

Andie will. They always do. Don’t

TANNER (CONT’D)
Amy has us in an interesting bind.
We need to tell the cops about Andie—they have to find out from
us. But right now, Andie just gives you another motive. We need to tell the cops about the woodshed—we have to be on the front end of that. But
let me tell you what will happen if we do: they will go after Go.
NICK
Go has nothing to do-
TANNER
Her property. Go was your
accomplice, she helped you hide the stuff, in all likelihood she knows you killed Amy.
NICK
So what do we do?

A red golf ball rolls into a hungry CROCODILE’S mouth. AMY, GRETA and JEFF are putting through a vacant, decrepit mini golf course. They hold plastic cups of beer.
AMY
Shouldn’t we keep score?
No one listens. GRETA putts wildly, her ball bouncing over an alligator’s mouth into the slimy water--two holes over. GRETA swats JEFF’S butt as he goes to retrieve her ball. He swats hers back and goes to fetch the ball. GRETA smiles after him.
AMY (CONT’D)
I thought we were steering clear of
men for a while. GRETA
He’s nice.
AMY
Because he wants to fuck you. *
AMY is sulking: She’s used to being the courtee. JEFF returns, drying the ball on his shirt before presenting it.

Greta pushes Amy’s face, the glasses jamming into Amy’s eyes. It’s a quiet, slow-motion death struggle. Until: Greta bangs Amy’s head against the wall, once, twice. HARD. Amy drops the belt. Greta looks through the cash. Thousands.

Holy shit!
Amy makes one last lame attempt to grab the belt, but Greta shoves her again, hard, her head hitting the cinder block. She drops to a crouch, dizzy. Her glasses are broken. One eye waters like a cut vein. Jeff and Greta stand over her.

He gives her a kiss on the cheek and leaves. Amy begins looking around. The BOOKSHELVES are filled with SELF-HELP books. Mostly about BEING a MAN. FIRE IN THE BELLY, BEING THE STRONG MAN A WOMAN WANTS, NO MORE MR. NICE GUY.
INT. DESI’S OFFICE - NIGHT 222
Amy goes through his drawers: Every single Amy Quiz she ever published, dutifully filled out. Her NYT marriage notice. Interviews she’s done with trivia of interest underlined.
The room’s a showcase to a concept Amy has never fully realized: If you want a man whose sole focus is YOU and BEING WITH YOU, this is what you get.

THWACK. The door opens. Amy turns off the TV. Desi enters, bearing a shopping bag.
DES I
Good morning1 *
AMY
You scared me. Don’t do that.
(softening)
I need to feel safe.
DES I
You are very safe. What have you * been up to?
The question is innocent but unnerving to Amy. AMY
Nothing.
DES I
Amy, I’m not Nick. You don’t need * walls. *
AMY
It’s hard for me. After so many * years, under someone’s thumb— *
DES I (pointedly)
I know just how that feels.
AMY
You were never under my thumb.
DES I On your leash?
AMY
Never.

DESI (CONT’D)
Decent clothes. Hair dye. Makeup.
Tweezers. There’s a gym on its way. The sooner you look like yourself, the sooner you’ll feel like yourself. I’ll get groceries for tonight. We’ll watch Sharon Schieber and finally move on.
AMY
I think that’s something I should
watch on my own. He kisses her forehead.
DES I
Nonsense. I’ll be back. I’m looking

Nick is slipping through the woods behind Go’s house. TWO NEWSVANS are in front, cameras on Go’s as the guys talk. NICK books to the house; Go opens the door for him as he hits it.

We can hear key words: “The girl everyone wanted to be,” “the marriage everyone admired,” “shocking debts,” “a surprise pregnancy,” “and a very young, very pretty secret.”
Desi is glaring at Amy’s un-dyed hair, her comfy cotton sundress. Amy doesn’t notice. She’s rapt.
SHARON (CONT’D)
Now, exclusively, a husband breaks
his silence not just on his wife’s disappearance but on his infidelity—and all those shocking rumors.
Cut to interview: NICK and SHARON sitting together.
On TV:
AMY
I bought that tie.
SHARON
Nick Dunne, you might be the most
hated man in America right now.
NICK
I think you’re probably right,
Sharon. And I probably deserve it.
SHARON
Did you kill your wife, Nick?
NICK
I did not kill my wife, Sharon. I
am not a murderer.
SHARON * But you were unfaithful. *
NICK * I was. I am not proud of my * actions. *
SHARON * You allowed Amy’s parents, Amy’s * friends, the people of your * hometown, to believe that you were * a loving husband who was desperate * to find his missing wife. *

NICK
I am desperate to find my missing
wife.
SHARON
I just wonder how you can ask us to
believe you, now that we know.. .you’re a liar?
NICK
I did not come forward about my
affair because I knew it would make me look very, very bad. I don’t care anymore about how I look. That’s done. I care about finding my wife.
SHARON
I’m just trying to get clear-
NICK
Let me say this: I am not a killer.
But I’m far from being a good guy. I was a bad husband to a wonderful
wife. I broke the vow I made to her.
SHARON
What does that mean to you, Nick?

NICK (CONT’D)
I met Amy Elliott seven years ago
and I was transfixed. Amy does
that. I was an average guy from an average place with mediocre aspirations, and I met this woman who dazzled me. And I wanted her to love me. I pretended to be better than I was. I made a pledge to her, when we married, to be that man.
INSERT: A perfect wedding portrait of NICK and AMY.
NICK (CONT’D)
The man who tries harder. The man
who thinks and acts and feels with as much passion as she does. The man who makes her happy. And I failed her. Instead of doing what was right, I did what was easy.
AMY is RAPT: These words RESONATE.
SHARON
You talk like a man who believes he
can still make amends to his wife. Who believes his wife is still alive.
NICK She is alive.
SHARON
OK, then. What would you like to
say to your wife tonight? NICK turns straight to the camera.
NICK
Amy, I love you. You are the best
person I have ever known. I have taken myself to the woodshed over the way I treated you. Come home andIwillspendtherestof.my
life making it up to you. I will be the man I promised you I’d be. Please come home.
He puts his finger briefly in the cleft of his chin. His watch is on camera. Amy smiles. DESI is watching Amy.

GO smiles. A small sense of relief passes over the two of the. And then: BANG BANG BANG! Through the windows, we see police swarming across the backyard. Toward the WOODSHED. Setting up perimeter to keep away reporters. Setting up flood lights aimed at the WOODSHED. Go opens the door.

Boney stops short, seething.
BONEY
I’ve treated you beyond fair

BONEY

Everything just waiting for the wife to go away for good.
But NICK has stopped paying attention because GO is being helped into a police car.
NICK
Hey, you can’t do that!
BONEY Of course we can.
We hear a strange CLICK and WHIR. Out of the woodshed comes the ROBOT DOG, a cop piloting the controller. The dog BARKS.
INT. LAKEHOUSE - NIGHT 231
Desi very deliberately turns off the Sharon Schieber show. Amy gets up to turn on the laptop. DESI takes it away.

Amy, it’s time to move on. What can
I do to help?

AMY looks truly panicked.

DESI (CONT’D)
I’m not going to force myself on
you.
He goes into the kitchen, begins taking away anything decadent. Cheese, chips, etc all go into a bag.
AMY
I understand what you’re saying,
Desi, I do. I’ve just been so mistreated, for so long, I’ve
forgotten how to behave.
DES I
I’ll move in here tomorrow. We’ll
work on it. Until we get it right. I just want you to be y~ again.
He runs his hand through the hair that should be blonde.

Nick and Tanner conferring as they head to interrogation.
TANNER
They only took Go to fuck with you.
NICK
She is not spending another second
here. We tell Boney everything.
TANNER
We tell Boney as little as
possible. Without a body, without a murder weapon, they’ll be desperate for a confession. So let them talk.
We can jumpstart your defense.
NICK
My defense is the truth.

BONEY gives him a stony look. Sets the diary on the table. * It’s singed on the sides but fine inside. *
BONEY (CONT’D) Recognize this?
NICK
I’ve never seen it in my life.
BONEY
Amy’s diary. We found it at your

NICK (moved)
Yeah, that’s true. Next sheet is slapped down.
BONEY
You thought quinoa was a fish?
NICK (sudden laugh)
I still don’t know what it is. She slaps down another sheet.
BONEY
She wanted to get pregnant—you
attacked her.
NICK
I hit her? Never.
BONEY
She says pushed. You pushed her.

Slaps down another sheet.

NICK
Convenient end note. *
GILPIN enters the room, motions to BONEY. They stand in the * doorway, joined by DONNELLY, who hands BONEY a bag. They * confer intensely in low voices. BONEY returns holding an * evidence BAG containing a burnt CLUB. She holds it up to the * JUDY puppet so NICK can see it’s the missing handle. *

BONEY
The missing handle. Big as a 2 by

NICK
I have never seen that. I have
never—
BONEY
We just tested it. Fire doesn’t

DES I You’re not bored?
AMY
Desi, you can discuss 18th century
symphonies, 19th century Impressionists, quote Proust—in French. Nick’s idea of culture was a reality TV marathon with one hand down his boxers and his other around a family-sized block of Velveeta.
Desi laughs, finishes his coffee, gets up. She rumples his hair. Then she KISSES him, BITES his lower lip. He rears back, surprised. She walks him just to the edge of the entryway. Yanks out his shirt teasingly.
AMY (CONT’D) That’s how the kids wear it.

A new camera shoots from PATIO through the glass into the DINING AREA. Amy stumbles into frame past a new Stairmaster and Bowflex. She’s in a ripped T-shirt and panties.

A few more thrusts and it’s over. AMY keeps her legs CLASPED around his waist as she grabs the BOX CUTTER from her bedside table. DESI has enough time to register confusion when:
SLASH. She slices him neatly through the JUGULAR.
The BLOOD pulses out as DESI grabs at his neck, but ANY won’t let him go. The two roll over, Amy on top, holding him down. DESI makes one more try for freedom and the two roll back around, him on top of her again. The BLOOD is everywhere: on the mattress, on the walls. AMY keeps her legs wrapped around Desi until he gives one last heave and DIES on top of her.
Amy’s beatific smile certainly indiOates she’s satisfied.

clubbed me. I collapsed.
BONEY
That club, it’s actually the handle * to the Punch and Judy puppets-

That’s right. Treasure hunt. That’s
what he hit me with. I’d hidden the puppets at Go’s...
BONEY
Then how did Desi have the handle?

fallen off. I was holding it when Desi pushed in. He got it from me.
BONEY About the woodshed
AMY (ignoring her)
I woke up in the trunk of his car.

NICK drops his clothes to the floor. AMY drops her clothes, runs her hands over him, tries to arouse him.
AMY
Need to make sure you’re not
wearing a wire.
She womanhandles him more. Nothing. She turns on the shower.
AMY (CONT’D)
Get in.
She motions him into the shower’. Might as well be wielding a
GUN. Inside the SHOWER the water SPRAYS against them as they stand face to face. Trickles of pink—Desi’s dried BLOOD—flow * from her hair down her neck. She tries to get closer to him. * He backs away. *
NICK
You’re a murderer, Amy. *
AMY
I’m a fighter. I fought my way back * to you. *
NICK
You slit Desi’s throat. With a box * cutter. *
AMY
You begged for me to save your life * on national TV. And I obliged. But * I want that Nick. *
NICK * I’m leaving. *
AMY * You really think that’s smart? * Wounded, raped wife battles her way * back to her husband—and he deserts * her? The media will destroy you. * Your neighbors will shun you. And I * will make sure no one forgets the * pain you caused me. *
NICK debates the truth of this. * *

NICK
I don’t want to deal with your
groupies outside. But as soon as they go, I go.
AMY
Give it the night. Sleep on it.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
AMY, dressed for bed, slips under the covers and pats the spot beside her. NICK pulls the covers over her.
NICK
Was there ever a baby?

GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 153.
On a big-screen TV, Ellen Abbott is roaring on about her new villain: DESI COLLINGS.
ELLEN
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn’t have her? He took her. It disgusts me...
Nick walks past without even looking. The former Find Amy Dunne headquarters is being dismantled. Over Amy’s “MISSING” poster are the happy words: FOUND! Champagne is popping. News cameras are everywhere. NICK passes RAND and MARYBETH with two glass of champagne. The three watch Amy, snapping photos with fans. NICK says the next line cheerily enough.
NICK
You two must be proud.
He sweeps past, tries to pull her from the clutch of reporters.
REPORTER ONE
Nick, what’s next for you and Amy?
Right now, it’s all about our marriage. If two people love each other and can’t make it work, that’s the real tragedy.
Cameras flash. Amy whispers sweetly into Nick’s ear.
AMY (CONT’D) (whispering)
Kiss my cheek. Now.
He kisses her cheek. She takes her champagne from him.

NICK sits with GO, BONEY and TANNER at a booth. Air of subterfuge. A TABLOID from the “Amy Found!” event sits on the * table: Nick kissing Amy on the cheek. Headline: “AMY DUNNE: * It’s all about our marriage!” *
GO * You can’t live in the same house as
that spider.

SIX DAYS HOME
NICK
Right now I can’t live anywhere but
in that house. When the media goes-
GO
When exactly do you think the media
will disappear? This thing’s only getting bigger.
ON TV: Amy—mania around the world. We see a crowd in China all wearing ANY T-shirts.
BONEY (pointing at TV)
People love her story: bad guy dead, husband repentant, golden girl home.
TANNER
Mess with it, they’ll come looking
for blood.
NICK (whispering)
She told me she murdered Desi. Not self defense. Murder.
GO
Can’t we wire him?
BONEY
I can’t get a wire. We had the
national spotlight on us, and we stained the rug.
NICK
It wouldn’t work anyway.
GO
She told you oncebefore.
NICK
We were in the shower.
Tanner can’t help himself.
TANNER
I swear to god, you two are the
most fucked—up people I’ve ever known. And I specialize in fucked up.

TANNER (CONT~D)
I mean, you and Amy in the same
house? I should pitch it as a reality show.
NICK
Great entertainment advice. What’s
your legal opinion?
TANNER
My legal opinion is: Don’t ever
turn your back on your wife.
NICK
No, my wife must always be faced.
The crowd hushes as AMY shows up on TV: Reporters have surrounded her as she tries to slip inside a grocery store.

AMY
Nick and I have had our bad
patches, our dark days. But I thank * you for forgiving him for what he * did and for supporting our new, * happy life together. Your * encouragement means the world. *
TANNER * Damn, she’s good. *
GO * It’s a spinoff. Amazing Amy and the * Humbled Husband. *
Tanner rises. *
TANNER * The Devoted Dunnes. I’ll stay * tuned. *
(to Go) * Take care of this guy, OK? *
NICK * You’re leaving? *
TANNER * You’re not at risk anymore. *

He leaves.
TANNER (CONT’D) Remember: Don’t turn your back.
GO
Elvis has left Missouri.
He looks out at the media vans, ENCAMPED. He hears something behind him, turns around to see AMY ghostly in her nightgown.

NICK I need time.
AMY
I’d never hurt you. I do need you
to participate though. That’s fair, right?

Marriage is about communication.

BONEY holds up a tabloid: NICK and AMY: A Second Chance at Love. The photo of them is ADORABLE.
BONEY
You could try it, but I don’t think
you’d have much peace afterward.
NICK
I don’t have peace now.
GO
Can you ask them to re—fingerprint—•
BONEY sighs: She’s now about to deliver the bad news.
BONEY
I can’t do anything. It’s with the
Feds. They’re done. So I have to be done. Orders.

I got a kid to feed, you know?

BONEY lingers for a moment. Then heads toward the door.
BONEY
Her name’s Mia, by the way.
NICK looks over at her: What? BONEY is walking out the door.
BONEY (CONT’D)
My kid. You asked me once. Her * name’s Mia.
For what it’s worth. And BONEY’s gone. It’s just GO and NICK. *
NICK holds up another TABLOID photo: NICK and Amy hand in hand in the park, laughing.
NICK
Remember what Mom always said? Tell
the truth and shame the devil.
He thinks, staring at the photo of false happiness.
NICK (CONT’D)
Fuck it. Let everyone take sides.
GO
Team Nick, Team Amy.
NICK

She sits next to him. Weaves her hand in his.

AMY (CONT’D)
Now: “How does it feel to have your
wife back, Nick?”
NICK
“Fantastic. How often does a guy
get a real second chance?”
AMY
Fantastic’s a little flippant.
NICK “Amazing?”
Amy rises, begins tidying up.
AMY
I’ll need you to admit that you got
the credit cards, you hid that stuff at Go’s and you did push me. I need those three things from you to feel safe.
Nick just stares at her: He can’t say it.
AMY (CONT’D)
You need to own this, Nick.
NICK
I know exactly what to say.
The doorbell rings.
INT. DUNNE LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

time, Nick.

You called me a murderer.
ELLEN
I go where the story goes.
NICK
You implied I had carnal relations
with my sister.
ELLEN
I said you two were close.
NICK
You said I was a sociopath.
Ellen digs through her bag. She pulls out a robot kitten.
ELLEN
To go with your robot dog. Little
ice breaker.
Nick stares stonily at her. Tosses it on the stairs. The camera crew begins setting up in the living room.
NICK I’ll get Amy.
INT. DUNNE BEDROOM - EVENING 270 ANY and NICK on the bed. Between them is a gift-wrapped BOX.
NICK
I do not want another gift from
you, ever.
AMY
Open it.
He opens it, slowly, dreading, and pulls out: A PREGNANCY STICK, with a BRIGHT BLUE POSITIVE SIGN.
NICK
I haven’t touched you.
AMY
You didn’t need to.
She waits for him to figure it out.
NICK
The notice of disposal. You threw
it out.

NICK
I want a blood test. I want a
paternity test.
AMY I love tests.
A long, sick moment.
NICK
You can’t make me raise a child
with you, Amy. I don’t love you.
AMY
Because you stopped trying.
NICK
We are toxic. We complete each
other in the sickest possible way.
AMY
You think you could ever be happy
with a nice, normal woman? No, baby. I’m it. I complete you. I’m the only one who can.
NICK
Amy: No.
AMY
Stay with me and I will make you
happy. You know I can. I’ve killed for you.

You can run away like a boy, or * stay. Raise your child. Be the man * you want to be. It’s your choice, * Nick. *

Amy turns, and gives him a haunting SMILE. * FADE TO BLACK. *
