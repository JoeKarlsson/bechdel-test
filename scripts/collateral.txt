A1   INT. BRADLEY TERMINAL - BLURS - DAY                           A1

     slide past in a 400mm lens. Then, entering a plane of focus is
     VINCENT. He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit.
     Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say
     "confident executive traveler." The suit's custom-made but not
     domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be
     difficult to describe his identifying specifics...grey suit,        *
     white shirt, medium height. And that's the idea...                  *

     CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT

     OVER his left shoulder, walking through milling travelers           *
     towards the distant wall of metal and glass, sunlight streaming
     at him...

     ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN

     - suit, blonde crew cut - walks to camera. Same sunlight, but
     it hits him from the side. His trajectory is from the left.
     His eyeline is slightly right. Just now, he looks down at a
     ticket in his hand...

     OVER VINCENT'S LEFT SHOULDER...

     right now something catches Vincent's eye.   And the two men bump
     into each other...

     TWO-SHOT...

                            VINCENT
                You okay?    Sorry...

     Vincent puts down his briefcase.   The man has a similar
     briefcase.

                          MAN
                    (North London working-
                     class accent)
                Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, mate.   Enjoy                      *
                LA...

     VINCENT GRABS THE BRIEFCASE OF THE MAN

     with the North London working-class accent. And continues
     towards the exit. Was it an accident? Was it a brush pass?
     The Man's accent signified nothing to us except one thing:
     foreign origin.

     VINCENT

     approaches until he's in ECU...

     OVERHEAD SHOT:   VINCENT

     up from the bottom of the frame, departs across the floor with
     the yellow tile, until we lose him into the milling hundreds of
     Angelenos, heading out into Greater LA and its eighteen million
     people.

     Images wipe across the screen, kinetic and abstract, floating
     and dreamlike in SLO-MO:

     Shades of yellow.   Ribbons of silver.    Shimmers of chrome.

     Headlights sweeping past, flaring to white. Brake lights
     flashing, halating red. Reflections of overhead fluorescence
     flowing like liquid along windshield glass...

     SOUNDS are dreamlike and abstract, reverberated and discordant,
     bouncing off concrete walls: car doors OPENING and CLOSING.
     Brakes. A BABBLE of multi-lingual crosstalk.

     Racing Forms. A Farsi newspaper. African hands on a                  *
     Blackberry. Max's hands do The New York Times crossword. A           *
     West African speaks French into a cell phone. Metallica in a         *

     Mechanics hands change tires, replace air cleaners, close a          *

     ORANGE and YELLOW FORD CROWN VICTORIAS are wiping screen. We         *
     find ourselves in a busy garage at change of shift. A balletic       *
     convergence of arriving and departing cars. One's door's flung
     open...

     LICENSE fitted into the small Lexan holder. On it is a picture
     of Max.

     Lights being checked. Indicators. Hazards. Switches. Similar
     to a pilot doing an aircraft check list. Fast. All fine.

    ...and WHAM! The noise evaporates.    Welcome silence.     Max takes
    a moment to savor it.

    He starts the engine.   RAP MUSIC BLARES from the radio.      Max
    turns it off.

    He dumps a CD into the changer. MOZART SONATA fills the cab.
    From the open briefcase, Max also pulls out one last thing...

    A TATTERED POSTCARD

    which depicts the whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.
    A dream place. An endorphin-releasing groove. Limitless
    horizon. It's the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean.

    MAX

    slips the postcard under the rubber bands on the visor. He can
    see it whenever he wants to. But not now. He flips the visor
    up, puts the car in gear and pulls out.

    northbound on the 405 or Harbor Freeway, an on-ramp to the east         *
    105. It's all magical in the light. Max's cab, rocketing along
    circulinear ramps into complexity of five traffic streams...

    ...harsh reality intrudes. Max is driving a YOUNG PROFESSIONAL
    COUPLE with carry-on bags, having a heated argument about...

                           MAN

    Max endures it silently, invisible as furniture.     He doesn't
    exist as far as his passengers are concerned...

    Up ahead, he sees a cluster of CHINESE GANGBANGERS in their
    early 20's wearing cheap suits, white shirts and no ties. Some
    guy gets pushed to the ground, punched and kicked while four or       *
    five watch, amused.

    Max's first instinct...                                               *

    One GANG MEMBER, eating take-out with chopsticks, hears, turns,
    sees Max.

                 Say what? What you lookin' at, bitch?
                     (stream of hot Cantonese)

    He throws his food container. Another throws a beer bottle.
    Max hits the accelerator as the bottle bounces off the rear
    windshield...

    corrosion from the fumes. We find Max cleaning Chinese take-out
    off his cab with the water hose while the gas pump CLICKS OFF.

    staring at the island. Soothed by the blue.

    We're seeing the most private of Max's rituals, the one he
    doesn't share with anybody.

    Now, he starts hustling for calls by posting himself in a nearby

     presumably, has dropped a load in front. He fills out his trip
     sheet. A pedestrian businessman asks directions to LAX. Max ad
     libs, directing him to the people-mover.

     Yellow cylindrical stairs...a pretty young WOMAN descends into
     the interior lobby.

     Max finishes his notation.

     The young WOMAN detours through media and the rush-hour crowd
     while talking rapid fire into a cell phone, starts toward Max's
     cab, waving at it...

     Max doesn't see her, starts to pull away.

     She gives up, turns toward a green City Cab behind her, but it
     just picked up a load.

     Then, Max catches sight of her and stops.   Red taillights.

     She turns and starts for the cab.

     We SEE Max regard her in his rearview mirror.   He ejects a CD
     and loads a different one.

      The woman, ANNIE FARRELL, enters the cab. Everything about her
      says "serious professional" from her suit to her briefcase and
      purse. Still on her cell, her attention is focused on the call.

                           ANNIE

                 Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea.
                 La Brea north to 6th into downtown.

      Max pulls away from the curb, starts the meter and turns left.

                           ANNIE (CONT'D)
                     (into cell phone)

      She ends the call, starts to check her voicemail on her phone.

                 110 turns into a parking lot around

                 Are we taking bets?   What if you're

      driving ranges.

     She sets the brief aside, eyes tired anyway. She notices the
     MUSIC playing faintly up front. Bach's "Air on a G String."

                  You mind turning this up?

     Max doesn't mind at all. He tweaks the volume up.       Annie leans
     her head back to listen, closes her eyes.

                            MAX
                  You like Bach?

                  I used to play this piece in high

                  Viola. I never had the lungs for wind
                  instruments.

                  Could'a fooled me, the way you were

     Max is focused on her eyes.                                         *

                No. Not in a cab. You need your head
                straight, gotta get your unified self
                up, get harmonic...you know...

                Dozen times a day.

     He flips the visor down, revealing the postcard of white
     beaches, clear green water. It's the first time he's shared
     this with anybody:

                          MAX (CONT'D)
                Maldives Islands. It gets heavy, I
                take five. Go there.

      On impulse, he slips the postcard free and offers it to her.        *

                           ANNIE
                 No, I couldn't take that...I couldn't.

                           MAX
                 Yes, you could. You need it more than
                 I do.
                     (off her hesitation)
                 It helps. I promise.

      She accepts the postcard, surprised and touched.    Her gaze
      lingers on his for a moment. She holds it.

                            ANNIE
                 Wow.   Thanks for everything, Max...

                           MAX
                 Sure thing.

      She gets out of the cab, starts to walk away...

      ...but turns back, ducking into the cab's window. Looking a bit
      flustered, she pulls a business card and offers it to him.

                           ANNIE
                 In case you ever...I don't
                 know...wanna start an investigation of
                 a Fortune 500 company or argue cab
                 routes or something...

      And with that, she goes towards the three assistants waiting for
      her outside the revolving door. Max is left somewhat stunned,
      holding her card. He glances down at it:

                           ANNIE FARRELL

      A hand punches a sequence of numbers into a keypad. The garage
      is visible beyond. The lock unlocks. We see it is Vincent who
      walks into the steel interior staircase from the garage.

16    INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - VINCENT - DUSK                         16   *

      emerges from the interior staircase into the lobby in his good      *
      suit with the expensive briefcase. Casually, he glances to his      *
      right. We don't know why...

     in front of him is a guard station and a row of tumbrils that
     require an identity card to not trigger and alarm. Vincent
     produces his card, scans it across the top.                        *

      The indicator goes GREEN. Vincent slips the card into his             *
      briefcase and walks through, towards the bank of elevators.           *
      However, he doesn't take an elevator. He walks past them              *
      towards an escalator down to the street. Why did he walk into,        *
      through and out of the lobby of the building?                         *

                   Did you ask her out?

      Vincent's read Max's mind. Max hadn't thought it through that
      far. Now that he does, reality sinks in. Annie's out of his
      league and he knows it.

      Gone forever, Max jams her card under the rubber bands on the

                No. To tell the truth, whenever I'm

                sprawled-out. Disconnected. You

                  but...

20   EXT. SOUTH UNION STREET APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                20

     A rundown, quasi-deserted area. Alienation in the twilight. A
     lonely tenant watches the city from an open window. Max's cab
     pulls to the curb...

                  Fourteen minutes.    Man, you're good...

                            MAX
                  Lucky with the lights.

                            VINCENT
                  Yeah, sure. You probably know the
                  light schedules, too.
                      (leans forward)
                  Listen...I'm in town on a real estate
                  deal. A closing. One night. I got
                  five stops to make, collect
                  signatures. See some friends. Then I
                  got a six a.m. out of LAX. Why don't
                  you hang with me for the night...?

                            MAX
                  I'm not a hire car.    It's against
                  regs...

                            VINCENT
                  Regulations? These guys don't pay you
                  sick leave.
                      (pulls his wallet)
                  How much you pull down a shift?

                            MAX
                  Two-fifty, four hundred.                                 *

                            VINCENT
                  I'll make it six hundred. Plus an
                  extra hundred if you get me to LAX and
                  I don't have to run for the plane.

     Vincent draws CRISP HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILLS from his briefcase,
     fans them like a magic trick. Meanwhile, a car pulls up behind
     double-parked Max. Vincent steals a glimpse of his PC. See a
     real estate prospectus-looking display.

                            VINCENT (CONT'D)
                  ...take a chance.

                  Man, I don't know.

                            VINCENT
                  Yes, you do.

                            MAX
                      (succumbs)
                  Yeah. Okay.

     Vincent smiles, gives him a firm handshake.

                Max?     I'm Vincent.

     Vincent gets out.    Max calls after him:

                          MAX
                I can't double park here...

                          VINCENT
                I'll meet you in the alley behind the
                building.

     Understood.   Vincent steps into the building foyer, while...

     Max puts the car in gear...

     brings the car to a stop and notices Vincent's briefcase lying
     on the back seat. A trusting soul. Max smiles.

                          MAX
                Definitely not from around here.

     He kills the engine.    Silence.

     There's a noticeable lack of city noise. DISTANT talk radio.
     Spanish gospel from a Baptist church. An occasional car passes
     the mouth of the alley.

     Max trades Mozart for Beethoven.

     Max checks his watch. Dinnertime.     He turns to his battered
     briefcase on the passenger seat.

     It's filled with carefully arranged items. NAPKINS in the
     pockets. UTENSILS in the pen holders. FOIL PACKS of mayo and
     mustard and Thousand Island Dressing. 1.5 liter PLASTIC BOTTLE
     of vitamin mineral water. The well-worn Mercedes brochure for       *
     the S500. A spreadsheet, like a handwritten business plan. A        *
     large submarine sandwich wrapped in two halves. Neat note pads.
     Everything's in methodical order.

      spreads Thousand Island on the sandwich. He glances up at the
      visor. He tilts it down, peering at Annie's business card,
      wondering what to do. Will he call her?

      He sits a moment, fighting a wave of sadness. Unhappy with
      himself. With his life. His place in the world.

      FROM THE FLOOR UP PAST MAX + THE STEERING WHEEL (VFX - GRN SCRN)    *

      up THROUGH the windshield is the twinkle of stars in the night
      sky. Suddenly, a dark shape from above blacks out the sky. It
      descends towards us. As Max takes a bite...

      ...WHAM! SOMETHING HUGE rocks the cab on its axles! GLASS rains
      down. A HEADLIGHT EXPLODES! The windshield FRACTURES! Max
      bounces off the ceiling. His submarine deconstructs all over
      the interior. His coffee spills...

      ...and then abrupt, stunning silence.

      What hit him. An earthquake?   Max takes a dazed beat.   He peers
      at the windshield...

      THE DEAD FACE OF A FAT MAN STARES AT HIM.
      Max recoils with a yell, scrambles from the cab, heart
      pounding...

24    EXT. ALLEY - FROM ABOVE:   CAB - NIGHT                        24    *

      A CORPSE is angled across part of his roof and windshield in a      *
      bathrobe. There's shards of window glass from upstairs
      everywhere. It makes a halo around the cab.

      Max is stunned.

      A window on the top floor is broken out.      A white curtain flaps
      in the breeze.

      Max's first thought:    this passenger will think Max ran into        *
      this guy.

                             MAX
                   He - He fell on my cab...!

                   Well, yeah. Yeah. Guy fell on my
                   motherfucking cab from up there...!

      Max looks up, points again, as if Vincent might have missed it        *
      the first time. Vincent's focus hasn't left Max.                      *

                             MAX (CONT'D)
                   I think he's dead.

                             VINCENT
                   ...taken two .45s and did a high dive
                   onto his head. It's a good guess.

      Max stares at Vincent. It's sinking in. Vincent, meanwhile,           *
      has to make his decision. About Max. Kill him and find
      another, or...

                             MAX
                   You - you killed him?

                             VINCENT
                   No. I - I shot him.     The bullets and
                   the fall killed him.

      A frozen beat. Everything's out in the open. Max realizes he's
      in trouble. He backs away, thinking escape...

      ...and like lightning, Vincent's .45 H+K is in his hand. To Max
      the .45 caliber bore is the diameter of the Spring Street
      tunnel.

      It cruises down the street and stops in front of the apartment
      building.

      RAY FANNING emerges from the car. Edged hair, an earring,             *
      sports clothes. A salesman or a player or a dealer. Forties, a
      face with character and some miles. And something insistent
      about his intent...

      He heads towards the entry gate, rings a buzzer. Waits a
      moment. Rings again. Nothing. Plus...he looks like he could
      kick your ass if he wanted to.

      He pulls a thin plastic card from an inner pocket of his jacket,
      jimmies the door lock...

      approaches across the balcony walkway against the junky palms
      and downtown skyscape.

      He knocks on the door...causing the door to swing in slightly.
      He glances down, sees the lock was pulled. Tensing, he fades to
      one side, his hand going to his holster at his hip.

      He draws a Beretta, reaches out and pushes the door all the way
      open...

      cautiously, alert for the slightest movement or sound.

     Reemerges. Nothing.

     THE BROKEN WINDOW

     Glass missing. He leans out. A dizzying drop. A halo of
     broken glass on the alley below...in the center of which is a
     big blank spot.

                            FANNING
                  Fuck.

     And he produces his police radio and we realize he's a cop.

31   INT. CAB, TRAVELING - MAX - NIGHT                              31

     Max winds his way through surface-street traffic, in shock,
     sneaking anxious glances at Vincent in back. Vincent's got the
     tablet PC from his briefcase, studying it. The silence is
     thick.

     Max's hand is shaking. He lifts it off the wheel, tries to
     steady his fingers. Vincent diverts some attention to Max...

                            VINCENT (O.S.)
                  Try deep breathing.

                            MAX
                  What?

                            VINCENT
                  Adrenaline's wearing off. You get
                  shaky after. Some people slip into
                  shock. It's not uncommon. Deep
                  breathing helps.

     Max starts drawing in breaths, letting them out slowly.

                            VINCENT (CONT'D)
                  Is that better?

                            MAX
                  I think so.

     They stop at a RED LIGHT. Max glances at the passenger seat.
     Dressing and stray pieces of lettuce and mortadella. He parks
     the gearshift and goes for the paper towels, cleaning up.

     Vincent over the tablet PC, taking in Max.    Softly:               *

                  It's a mess.

                             VINCENT
                  So?

     Max keeps wiping, as if getting the seats clean might put
     everything right again.

     A CAR HORN HONKS behind Max.       The car whips around them to get
     through the intersection.

                             DRIVER

                nobody gets out of this alive. Even
                if we quit smoking. Cut out red meat.
                Everybody dies...

     Suddenly -- A BRILLIANT GLARE OF FLASHING LIGHTS stabs at the
     cab. Max sees --

     -- an LAPD CRUISER behind the cab.   The ROOFTOP LIGHTS
     FLASHING...

                          COP #1 (P.A.)
                Please pull the vehicle over to the
                curb.

     Max complies. A second bright beam lights up the interior.    TWO
     UNIFORMED COPS emerge from the patrol car. Faceless
     silhouettes, approaching cautiously.

                          VINCENT
                    (low)
                Get rid of 'em.

                          MAX
                How?

                          VINCENT
                You're a cabby. Talk yourself out of
                a ticket.

     The cops are now circling to either side of the cab, using
     Maglite FLASHLIGHTS.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

     Vincent eases the briefcase off his lap, his hands clear his
     field of movement, spread open his jacket to better reach his
     waistband and his H+K.

                           MAX
                Please.   Don't do anything.

                          VINCENT
                Then don't let me get cornered.     You
                don't have the trunk space.

                          MAX
                I can't believe this...

     Vincent's hand reaches...

                          VINCENT
                Believe it.

                          MAX
                Don't. I'll talk to them, I'll talk
                to them...!

                          VINCENT
                    (re: cops)
                Probably married.

     A COP'S HAND descends to the driver's window, raps loudly, GOLD
     WEDDING BAND catching the light as it taps on the glass.

                          VINCENT (CONT'D)
                Maybe that one's got kids.     Probably                 *
                his wife's pregnant...

                          MAX
                I'll deal with it!

     A FLASHLIGHT BEAM pops on at the driver's window.    Cop #1
     glaring light into Max's eyes.

     A SECOND FLASHLIGHT BEAM pops on, this from Cop #2 on the
     passenger side. Checking out Vincent in the back. Vincent
     smiles good-naturedly.

     Max rolls his window down. Cop #1 leans down, and we see his
     face for the first time. A clean-cut blonde guy.

     Max pulls them off the visor, hands them over.   The cop examines
     them by flashlight.

                          COP #1 (CONT'D)
                Pulled you over 'cause your                              *

                          MAX
                Yes, officer.

     From the other side of the cab, COP #2 lets out a laugh. He's
     playing his flashlight beam across the seats. Mustard and mayo
     everywhere.

                          COP #2
                Wha'd you, have a food fight in here?

     Max gives Vincent an "I told you so" look in the rearview
     mirror. Meanwhile, we HEAR dimly on the POLICE RADIO about a
     domestic disturbance on 83rd and Hoover and some officers
     responding.

     Cop #2 plays his beam across the cracked windshield and damaged
     hood. Faint reddish traces in the paint. His smiles fades.

                          COP #2 (CONT'D)
                Is that blood?                                           *

                          MAX
                Yeah. See...
                    (thinks fast)
                I hit a deer.

                            COP #1
                A deer...

                          MAX
                Over by Slauson.

                          COP #1
                A "South Central" deer?

                          MAX
                Goddamn deer jumped out in front of
                me. You believe that?

                          COP #1

                Why you still carrying a passenger?

                I was headed back to my depot, see,

                          COP #1
                Yeah, but your cab's not safe to
                drive. And we're going to impound it.
                We need to do a vehicle inventory
                while we wait for the tow truck. Pop
                the trunk and step out of the vehicle.

                I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to phone
                for another cab.

                          VINCENT
                Is that necessary, Officer?   I'm just
                a half mile from here.

                          COP #1
                I'm afraid it is.   Please exit the
                vehicle.
                    (to Max)
                You, too.

     Max hears a SOFT CLICK behind him. The unmistakable sound of a
     safety CLICKED OFF. He meets Vincent's gaze in the rearview          *
     mirror. A whisper:

                          VINCENT
                You open that trunk, they go inside.

     Behind Vincent, through the rear windshield, Max sees Cop #2
     moving to the trunk, playing his flashlight across it...

     Max, mouth dry...

                          MAX
                Hey, man, it's been a long day. You
                know? It's so slow, I pay this guy to
                ride so I don't get lonely...
                    (re: Vincent)
                My first fare. How about a break?
                I'm heading to the barn, anyway...

                          COP #1
                Get out of the car.   And open the
                trunk...

     Max tosses a hopeless look into the rearview.    Vincent's staring
     at him. No mercy there.

     Max steps from the car. The cop escorts Max toward the rear,
     Vincent smoothly pulls his H+K from his waistband and emerges on
     the passenger side, gun held out of sight and a heartbeat away
     from opening fire...

     ...a CRACKLE OF STATIC, a PANICKY VOICE COMES OVER THE POLICE
     BAND:

     The cops pile into their black-and-white and ROAR off into the
     night.

     Max and Vincent are left standing, gazing across the cab at each
     other.

                           VINCENT
                Breathe.

     Max starts deep-breathing as they get back in the cab...

                I thought Californians exercised...?

     REVEAL Vincent looking at his PC. Vincent pulls from his
     briefcase an identity card for a Notary Public and a second gun,
     a .45 Cal Para-Ordnance back up. He moves the slide, checking
     there's a round in the chamber. Max hears metal on metal, looks
     up. As Vincent holsters it in the small of his back...

     front.

                Hands on the wheel. Ten and two.

                Tell him to stick the cab up his fat

     Vincent abruptly puts the mike to his mouth, thumbs the toggle.

     Vincent clicks off, hangs up the mike.   Looks at Max.

     Beat.   Max, taped to the steering wheel, nods.

       Max watches in the sideview mirror as Vincent vanishes into the
       building.

       Max is left alone, trapped in his own cab in the alley.

       Max jerks and strains against the duct tape, trying to free his
       hands. He gives up, breathing hard.

       He glances in the sideview, wondering where Vincent is,
       straining for a glimpse.

       Nothing.   Just darkness back there...   Mind racing...

                             MAX
                  HEY!   HEY! OVER HERE!    I'M IN THE
                  CAB!   HEY! HELP!

       The street traffic's distant; nobody's around.

                           MAX (CONT'D)
                  HELP! GODDAMN IT! THERE'S A MAN WITH
                  A GUN! HE'S GONNA KILL PEOPLE!

       Max thrashes wildly against the duct tape, screaming with
       frustration. He starts head-butting the car horn...

       BEEEEEP!   BEEP-BEEEEEEEEP!   BEEEEEP!   BEEP-BEEP-BEEEEEEEEEP!

       He raises his head, checking the street traffic a quarter block
       away. No one on the sidewalk takes notice of Max's cab.

      He shifts low on the seat, getting his knee under the dashboard.
      He slams his knee up, hitting the RED EMERGENCY LIGHT BUTTON
      concealed there. EMERGENCY STROBES START FLASHING at the front
      and rear of the car...

      ...and still nobody notices.

                             MAX (CONT'D)
                   GODDAMN IT, I'M FLASHING LIKE A
                   CHRISTMAS TREE OVER HERE.

      He throws a look to the sideview mirror, sweaty and tense,
      knowing he's out of time.

      THE SIDEVIEW MIRROR

      IN WHICH WE SEE Max's reflected eyes.   Seconds ticking
      breathlessly away as he struggles...

      He head butts the horn again.   BEEP-BEEP.   BEEEEP.    Flashers and
      horn!

      MEANWHILE the ANGLE SHIFTS in the mirror, leaving Max's eyes and
      bringing into view the building and the penthouse at the top and
      we SEE...

      ...TWO SILENT MUZZLE FLASHES light up the windows like
      flashbulbs going off. Another death. Then A THIRD FLASH...then
      nothing. Lights out. Meanwhile...

                           MAX (CONT'D)                                      *

      He is head-butting the horn. BEEEEP. BEEP-BEEP.        And he checks   *
      the mirror. This time when he looks, he sees...

      YOUNG WHITE GUYS. 20-25. They were on the sidewalk. Now they
      detour into the alley and approach the distressed cab from the
      back, shielding their eyes from Max's flashing lights.

                           MAX (CONT'D)
                 Oh. Oh, thank God! Hey, hey, man,
                 help me out here!

                           WHITE GUY #1
                 Yo, whassup?

                           MAX
                     (fast, stumbling)
                 I got my, my hands taped to the
                 steering wheel, here, by this guy,
                 who's taped me in the car, 'cause he's
                 up in the building somewhere...

      CLOSER, now, the four are in baggies, hoodies and tattooed with
      lightning bolts on their necks, swastikas on chests, one has
      "5150" tattooed on his shaven eyebrow (police code for
      emotionally disturbed)...

                           WHITE GUY #2
                 You all trapped in there and shit?

                           MAX
                 ...yeah, he's coming back. Hurry.
                 Get me loose so I can call the cops...

      WHITE GUY #1 nods...and pulls a chromed .380 and points it at
      Max.

      The others have walked off down the alley, laughing. One tosses    *
      a beer bottle that smashes. Utter disbelief from Max...

                           MAX
                 Are you kidding me?

                           WHITE GUY #1
                 I will fuck you up! Hand it over.

                           MAX
                     (beat)
                 My hands are taped to the damn
                 steering wheel!

      It takes a moment for WHITE GUY #1 to process this. He steps to
      the window, presses the .380 against Max's cheek. It's utterly
      terrifying, everything happening fast:

                           MAX (CONT'D)
                 ...don't shoot me, don't shoot me...

                           WHITE GUY #1
                 Then get your ass up, up...

      Max pulls himself up by the steering wheel, trying to get his
      butt off the seat to give the Young Man access. The White Guy
      #1 gropes for Max's back pocket, trying to get the wallet,
      pressing the gun to his face, the other guys down the alley,
      turn the corner.

      White Guy #1 pulls Max's wallet, pockets it...

      ...and pauses, seeing Vincent's briefcase on the back seat.

      He yanks open the back door, grabs Vincent's briefcase, too, and
      walks off after his friends. White Guys #3 and #4 turned the
      corner. White Guy #2 lingers.

      Max, still taped, is shaken. He can't believe what happened.
      He looks through the windshield at...

      WHITE GUY #1

      ...walking off, cocky as hell, about to vanish into the night...

      BACK OF WHITE GUY #1

                           VINCENT (O.S.)
                 Yo' homie...

      White Guy #1 turns, to see the silhouette of Vincent. He raises
      his .380 side-handed, like he sees gangsters do on MTV. White
      Guy #2 joins him.

      White Guy #1 approaches Vincent from the front...#2 from
      Vincent's left.

                            WHITE GUY #2
                 May-be.   And what the fuck else you
                 got?

      He closes on Vincent with the .380, held high and on the side.
      Vincent's left slams aside #1's .380. Draws and FIRES from the
      hip, putting TWO ROUNDS into #1. HAMMERS-ON TWO ROUNDS to the
      sternum, pivots. ONE to the head of #2. All in 1.6 seconds.

      White Guy #2, falling backwards, is dead before he hits the
      ground. #1 never saw it coming. Vincent picks up his case,
      retrieves something from #1's pocket, puts one more into the            *
      head of #1 on the way back to the cab...

      ...where Max saw it all.   Frozen in horror.   Astonished.

      The rear door opens. Vincent hefts his briefcase into the back
      seat. He gets into the front.

      Vincent sits for a moment, staring off, not looking at Max.
      Maybe ready to kill him.

      Vincent raises something into view.    Max's wallet.     He tosses it
      in Max's lap.

      Vincent flicks his hand. CLICK-CLACK, a Reeves folding hunter
      in dull metal, razor sharp...

                           VINCENT
                     (quietly)
                 Where's the button?    Under the dash?

                           MAX
                     (dry whisper)
                 Yeah.

      Vincent leans over and slices the plastic tie, freeing Max's
      hands. Beat.

                           VINCENT
                 You mind turning it off?

      Max doesn't move for a moment, then reaches under the dash and
      turns off the strobes.

33    INT. CAB - MAX + VINCENT (TRAVELING) - NIGHT                   33

      Vincent in the back seat. (Juxtapose to a different continuity.      *
      Through the side window, we see Crenshaw Boulevard barbershops,      *
      music shops. We're stopped for a light.) Max is shell-shocked.

                            VINCENT
                  Another collateral.

                            MAX
                  What's that?

                            VINCENT
                  Collateral damage. People in the
                  wrong place at the wrong time.
                      (meets Max's gaze)
                  And you? You attract attention? You

      race by. WIDEN. SEE Max filling up the taxi. Vincent is
      positioned off the right rear corner from where he is line-of-
      sight to everything. His affect is flat, distant. Max has
      witnessed violent death and the full, lethal capabilities of
      Vincent. Neither say a word...until softly...

                              MAX

                            VINCENT
                  I haven't decided.

      Max is silent. Absorbing this. Vincent checks his watch.
      Unexpectedly, his mood changes up.

      COPS and FORENSIC TECHNICIANS.   In the midst of it all is:

      Ray Fanning. He wears his badge, visibly, now. We find him
      turning as his superior, RICHARD WEIDNER, 50-ish, is entering
      the crime scene.

                           WEIDNER
                 ...this informant of yours, what's his

                 Ramone Gallardo. Supposed to take him
                 for a drink. I come here, find this.

     He spreads his hands at the alley floor in a gesture that says
     "show me something besides glass."

                Did he "see" it or did his seeing eye
                dog see it?

                          FANNING
                Remember fall, 2001? That Bay Area                     *
                deal? Oakland. Cabbie drove around                     *
                all night. Killed three people...

                          WEIDNER
                Then he flipped out, put the gun to
                his head. So what?                                     *

                          FANNING

                whatshisname, never bought it.

                          WEIDNER
                Why?

                          FANNING
                The Cabbie had no criminal record. No
                history of mental illness. Pops three
                people, then himself? And the victims
                weren't random. Two were involved in
                some pharmaceuticals scam...
                    (off Weidner's look)
                Anyway, the detective always thought
                there was somebody else in that cab.

35   INT. "DANIEL'S" JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT                            35

     Dark and elegant - in an early '60's modern jazz kind of way
     with a low ceiling, small tables, leatherette booths, history
     soaked into the walls. A BLACK MAN in his late 50's, DANIEL, is
     playing a muted trumpet on stage with a QUARTET.

     CUSTOMERS are few, clustered at small tables or at a few curved
     leather booths. The walls are lined with great FRAMED PHOTOS of
     jazz icons.

     At one table, we find Vincent and Max.   Vincent about the
     music...

                         VINCENT
               He is terrific. Would you be so kind                       *

     Vincent gives her a radiant smile and tucks a twenty dollar bill
     into her apron as she leaves...

                                                 TIMECUT:

     ...and we find Daniel sharing more than a few drinks with
     Vincent and Max, the place almost closed. Just the three of
     them.

                         DANIEL
               ...I was a young cat back then, about
               nineteen, bussin' tables. Right here.
               Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't
               the point. Being around the music,
               that was the thing. And I was. Take
               this one night...July 22, 1964...who
               walks in. Mr. Louis Armstrong.

                         VINCENT
               You're kidding me.

                         DANIEL
               Right through those doors.     The man
               himself.

                          VINCENT
               Jesus...

                         DANIEL
               He was in town playing two gigs a
               night at the Coconut Grove in the
               Ambassador Hotel... After his last
               set, he decides to come on down to
               South Central to hang with his people.
               That's how he was, you see. Never
               forgot who we was. Money and fame an'
               all that? Meant nothin', long as he
               could blow that horn.

                So before you know it, he's up on that
                stage, doin' his thing.

                          VINCENT
                Was it great? Better than great, it
                had to be...

                          DANIEL
                Like Winton Marsalis says, it was
                pure, spiritual essence. Louis was
                playing. God was smiling.

                          VINCENT
                You heard Armstrong play live. I've
                never been this jealous. You get to
                talk to him?

                          DANIEL
                Did better'n that.

     Vincent gives him a questioning look.     Daniel smiles, raises his
     hands, mimes blowing a trumpet.

                           VINCENT
                No.

                          DANIEL
                Oh, my, yes.

                           VINCENT
                C'mon...

                          DANIEL
                Fella owned this place back then, cat                      *
                named Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis                      *
                that I played. So Pops, he just waves
                me right up. My heart about stopped.
                But I got up there all the same, and
                we played for nearly twenty minutes.

                          VINCENT
                Unbelievable...
                    (to Max)
                ...you hearing this?

     Max is drawn into the story in spite of himself:

                         MAX
                How'd you do?

                         DANIEL
                How do you think? You ain't shit when
                you playing next to Louis Armstrong.
                But, Dippermouth, he was kind. He
                could see me trying. He carried my ass
                as best he could.

                I was born in 1945, but that was the

                folks in Culiacan and Bogota that

                I am a cool guy. With a job I was
                hired to do. You know how it is.

     There's genuine regret in Vincent's tone. Max feels his heart
     pounding, but manages to keep his voice steady:

                          MAX
                Let him go, Vincent.

                          VINCENT

                going with the flow. You like the

                Jazz question. You get it right, we

                Then let's have it.

     Daniel hesitates.

                It was a trumpet!   Wasn't it?   Wasn't
                it a trumpet?

     Daniel shakes his head.

                          DANIEL
                Coronet. Bought it from a New Orleans
                pawnshop when he was a kid.

                           DANIEL (CONT'D)
                 Cost him five dollars. Got a two-                          *
                 dollar advance on his salary from a
                 fine Jewish family he worked for,
                 saved up the rest.

     A frozen moment. An endless pause.        Max not even breathing,
     staring at Vincent, waiting...

     ...a beat of regret...

     ...and Vincent's gun came up so fast, Max didn't even see it.
     THREE SMALL POPS. A different gun: .22 caliber Ruger with a
     thick, silent barrel. Three small holes. And Daniel's head
     falls forward. Vincent catches it, arranges Daniel's arms so
     that Daniel's head rests on them as if he's taking a nap. And
     Vincent did it gently, almost regretfully. A red mist of blood
     swirls in the air.

     Max is stunned beyond words, and powder-burned at such close
     range.

     Silence now. No one's noticed.        The waitress was in the
     kitchen. Softly:

                           VINCENT
                 Tin horn. Cost him a dime. Rode the junk                   *
                 wagon and played for the neighborhood.
                 People sold them stuff. Rags.
                 Bottles. Whatever.

     Max sits frozen, unable to move...

                                                    CUT TO:

36   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT                             36

     ...and they exit the club.     Vincent heads for the cab, turns and
     sees Max standing there.

                             VINCENT
                 Let's go.

                             MAX
                 No.

                           VINCENT
                 What you mean, no?

                             MAX
                 I'm done.    Find another cab.

     Max turns, walking away.      Vincent blinks at him, almost laughs.

                              VINCENT
                  Max?

                            MAX
                  Leave me alone.
                      (shouting)
                  I'm collateral anyway, so do it and                      *
                  stop making me a part of this!                           *

                  I don't wanna know you!

     Vincent grabs the back of his collar, slams him against the
     wall. Max's neck is a centimeter from breaking. Their faces
     are inches apart.

                            VINCENT                                        *
                      (low, threatening)
                  I'm not playing.

                            MAX
                  You played him, man.                                     *
                      (off Vincent's look)
                  He got the answer right, would you                       *
                  have let him go?

     The question hangs in the air.      Before Vincent can answer, the
     DISPATCH RADIO CRACKLES:

                             LENNY (FILTERED)
                  Max?   Maaax. Pick up, you dipshit.

                            VINCENT
                  What is it with this guy?

                              LENNY (FILTERED)
                  Maaaaaax!

     Vincent spins Max, controls him, as he propels him to the cab,
     slams him against the fender.

     Vincent releases him, points at him. Don't move. He reaches
     into the cab, pulls out the radio mike, clicks it on.

                            VINCENT
                  You hassling my man again?

                mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin'
                on a rainbow! May he come on the

                Hang on.
                    (to Max)
                Carefully...

     Max takes the hand mike, clicks it on.

                          MAX
                Yeah?

                          LENNY (FILTERED)
                Your mother's calling every ten

                What am I, related to you?     You tell
                her yourself!

     Lenny CLICKS OFF.   Dead air.

                          VINCENT
                Show up for what?

                          MAX
                She's in the hospital.

     Stark corridors, queasy fluorescent lighting, PATIENTS and STAFF
     MEMBERS. A row of INJURED PEOPLE are seated along one wall,
     waiting for attention.

     The AUTOMATIC DOORS swing open. Max and Vincent enter, the
     briefcase held at Vincent's side. As they enter and proceed up
     the corridor...

                          VINCENT
                Stay three paces in front of me and
                one to my left...

     Max, seeing the innocent people along the walls, complies.
     Vincent sees in the ceiling a security camera mounted in a
     Perspex hemisphere and averts his face towards Max...

                           VINCENT (CONT'D)
                Flowers?

     Max turns, sees a row of FLOWER BOUQUETS at the gift counter.

                          MAX
                Waste of money.   Won't mean a thing to
                her.

     Vincent pulls an arrangement, tosses the flowers to Max, pulls
     his wallet to pay.

                          VINCENT
                No harm done, madam.

     She takes the flowers from Max, making a fuss over them:

                          IDA
                You paid for my flowers? They're
                beautiful. Max, will you introduce
                us?

                Mom, Vincent.   Vincent, my mother,
                Ida.

     Vincent sets his briefcase by the door, approaches the bed,
     offers his hand. She takes it. He glows with charisma.

                          VINCENT
                I'm really happy to meet you, Mrs.                       *

                Oh, call me Ida.    To what do we owe
                this pleasure?

     Vincent sits in the chair at bedside.

                          VINCENT
                Well, I was with Max when he got the
                call.

                          IDA
                And you came all the way here to see
                me?

                          VINCENT
                It's nothing.

                          IDA
                Tell my son. You have to hold a gun
                to his head to get him to do anything.

                          VINCENT
                Tell me about it.

     Vincent leans in, helps her adjust her pillows.

                          IDA
                You must be an important client of
                Max's.

     This catches Vincent slightly off guard.    He glances to Max.

                          VINCENT
                Client? I like to think of myself as
                his friend. A mentor.                                    *

                          IDA
                Max never had many friends. Always
                talking to himself in the mirror...
                It's unhealthy.

                          MAX
                Hey, mom. How many times do I have to
                ask you not to do that?

                    (back to Vincent)
                He's sensitive.

                            VINCENT

                Of course I'm proud. You know, he
                started with nothing. Look at him
                today. Here. Vegas. Reno...

     Vincent looks at Max...squirming under the exposure.

                          MAX
                Mom, Vincent's not interested.
                    (to Vincent)

      So is the briefcase.
      Vincent races out into...

      Nothing but a FEW PATIENTS and HOSPITAL STAFF...

      ...and a door marked "STAIRS" swinging shut at the end of the
      hallway. He runs in that direction...

40B   INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL                                        40B

      careening dizzily down the steps with the briefcase, hurtling

      EXIT DOOR at the far end...

      ...and Vincent bursts from the stairwell in pursuit, pausing to
      whip his H + K up in a two-handed grip, aiming down the length
      of the laundry room...

                We've had three come in tonight. Two
                John Does. Maybe one's your guy.

     The attendant nods at the first of four PLASTIC-WRAPPED CORPSES
     lying on stainless steel tables. Fanning draws the sheet back:
     Homeless Man with a beard.

     at the next corpse.

                            FANNING (CONT'D)
                  Try that one.

     The attendant draws the sheet back. It's the Younger Man who
     mugged Max and took Vincent's briefcase.

                             FANNING (CONT'D)
                  No.   Next...

                            ATTENDANT
                  That's what's funny. These three came
                  in within half an hour of each other.
                  And the kid and that last guy (number
                  4)...they were done by the same
                  shooter.

                            FANNING
                  Why do you say that?

     Fanning gets alert.

                            ATTENDANT
                  Same wound pattern. Two in the

                  Double taps are a couple millimeters
                  apart.

     Intrigued, Fanning steps to the fourth corpse.      Attendant draws
     the sheet back.

     Fanning stares down at the dead face.      Instant recognition.

     a crowded bedroom overlooking MacArthur Park or palm trees and
     city lights, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. INTERCUT as

     Max drives in self-conscious silence, feeling Vincent's gaze
     on the back of his neck.

                          VINCENT
                Limos, huh?

     Vincent enters text into a cell phone/pager.

                Hey, I'm not the one lying to my

                          VINCENT
                Yeah, right. Maybe she hears what you
                tell her.

     Vincent sends.   Waits.

                  You're goin' to a place called El

      a hard location. On the monitors are multiple views of El
      Rodeo's exterior entrances, two ND homes, the interior of two ND
      cars. One agent watches Max cross to the El Rodeo entrance.
      The room is littered with SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT and pizza
      boxes.

      SENIOR AGENT FRANK PEDROSA, permanently agitated, stands.      The
      camera on Max ZOOMS in, tracking him.

      Entrance does NOT have a crowd waiting to get in past disco
      bouncers. Only light traffic flows in and out. But, it does
      have extensive security. Max, hiding his terror, steps up to
      two men at the door.

     ...as Max is led into a cavernous, blue Day-Glo Sinaloan disco.

     And they move through dancers, in Sinaloan style: white cowboy
     hats, jeans, braided key chains, endangered-species cowboy
     boots. Hot ladies in spandex and other couture by Earl Scheib.

     corrida singers...more sophisticated security appears. PACO
     pats down Max. Another, Rubio, cautiously covers him. Then...

     MAX

     Reserved elegance...

                But my children do. They are still

                even better than Santa Claus? His
                helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter.
                There's an old Mexican tale that tells
                of how Santa Claus got so very busy
                looking out for the good children that
                he had to hire some help to look out
                for the bad children. So he hired
                Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a
                list with all the names of all the bad
                children, and Pedro would come every
                night to check them out. And the
                people, the little kids that were
                misbehaving, that were not saying                        *
                their prayers, Pedro would leave a
                little wooden donkey on their windows.
                And he would come back and if the
                children were still misbehaving, he
                would take them away and nobody would
                ever see them again. Now, if I am
                Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do
                you think jolly old Santa Claus would
                feel if one day Pedro came into his
                office and said, 'I lost the list.'?
                How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa
                Claus would get?!

     Paco's gun is visible.   Safety clicks off Rubio's SMG.

                          FELIX (CONT'D)
                So tell me, Vincent. Tell me what you

      deeper among the dancers, now SEES distantly...

      PETER YIP

      for a moment. He's located towards the back wall across the
      dance floor in a booth on a raised area in the semi-circular
      room. With him are too-young Korean girls and a heavyset
      Rapper. The view got blocked by an African-American and a
      Korean bodyguard in suits near the booth, facing out.

      Behind the booth are five or six Korean gangsters.    But on the
      dance floor, itself...

      VINCENT SPOTS

      an outer perimeter of security. Bodyguards within the crowd,
      facing outward from the booth...looking for trouble before it
      gets to the row of booths and Peter Yip.

      MAX

      receives the glance from Vincent. He's gestured down the middle
      of the dance floor towards the rear. They work their way
      through the mass of bodies. Meanwhile, Vincent casually smiles
      at a girl and takes an oblique path, sliding along a convex side
      wall. Vincent's path brings Vincent up behind Bodyguard #1, who
      looks to the right as...

      BODYGUARD #1

      pounded in the kidney. His head is twisted around and torn
      back, dropping him to the floor amid the bodies and noise.
      Vincent's focus is already on BODYGUARD #2, as he kicks down
      with ferocious force, slamming Bodyguard #1 into
      unconsciousness...

      Bodyguard #2 intuits, turns. Vincent's foot slams his knee
      sideways, breaking it, Vincent's palm bounces the man's forehead
      back, his fist slams into his exposed neck, that fast.

      MAX

      buffeted by dancers, saw, backs away, as...

      BODYGUARD #3                                                       *

      saw the assault on #2. He grabs for Vincent...who breaks the
      grab, pulls Bodyguard #3's head and neck down towards him, slams
      his knee into his rib cage twice, breaking things, spins the man
      backwards, rips his head sideways and back, a centimeter from
      breaking, and holding it there with his left arm, Vincent's
      right hand is filled with the H+K as he moves towards Peter Yip.

      him. People who aren't falling away from him are confused. Max

      Traps the man's arm. Takes his baton, releases his torqued body

      Korean Gangster is blown back. Another tries to help 300-pound

      the banquette, his eyes wider because Vincent's coming. Vincent
      reloads. As his thumb hits the slide release and it jacks
      forward, he's already FIRED a round into Yip. And Yip's eyes -
      at the fierce face of death approaching - are filled in his last
      moments with Vincent, who FIRES four rounds. And one to the

                   Why'd you have to do that? You
                   couldn't wound him? The guy had a
                   family, maybe parents, kids who gotta
                   grow up without a dad, he was a good
                   guy, and he believed me...

                   I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed
                   you...?

                   the prosecution" look to me. It's
                   probably some major federal indictment
                   against somebody who majorly does not
                   want to get indicted... I dunno.

                   No good reason; no bad reason. To

                 All it ever took was a down payment on

      The cab goes blasting through an intersection on a red light.       A
      LOS ANGELES TIMES DELIVERY TRUCK SLAM ON ITS BRAKES as Max
      swerves, barely avoiding a collision.

                           VINCENT
                 That was a red light!

      Max glances in the rearview.

      Vincent's H+K's aimed at Max's head.   Max almost laughs.

      Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror. Vincent is arrested by
      a look in Max that he's not seen before. It's the even,
      confrontational look of a man with nothing to lose.

                           MAX (CONT'D)
                 Go fuck yourself.

      Max slams on the brakes and cranks the steering wheel hard

      Wreckage. Steam from the ruptured radiator. Crumpled metal.
      Missing hood. Disintegrated windshield...shattered glass.

      Max is trapped upside-down in his seatbelt, his roof half caved
      in, one side of his face streaked with blood. Alive but dazed.

      Movement in the back.    Sharp intake of breath.   Then a voice...

                              VINCENT
                   Well.   That was brilliant.

                             MAX
                   Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?

      -- and a BLOODY HAND shoots from the darkness behind him,            *
      plunging an aluminum section that used to hold the perspex
      screen in place. Max jerks his head aside and the aluminum rail
      misses him by inches, ramming solidly into the headrest instead.

      Max releases his seatbelt, dropping and hitting the ceiling of
      the cab. Vincent, sardined in the reduced space in the back,
      lunges forward. Max wildly fights to keep the knife at bay and
      crawl out his window. We hear a POLICE SIREN. Vincent, eyes
      glittering, kicks out the window on the other side.

      Max, crawling away on the pavement, keeping low, the taxi
      between them, looks back...

      MAX'S POV:   VINCENT

      ...in a glimpse, running off into the night. Vincent's hand
      pulls the .45 Para Ordnance backup from his waistband.
      Vincent's SHOES CRUNCH on broken glass. He vanishes into
      darkness as the SIREN GROWS near...

      Max pushes painfully to his feet.    Looks around.

      A surreal moment. Max standing by his overturned cab, the empty
      city all around him, breathing the cool night air.

      Alive.

      It strikes him in that moment. He's survived the night. The
      blood pumping through his veins is a fact. It stuns him.
      Overwhelms him.

      How good is life?

      The LAPD black and white screeches to a stop.      A SERGEANT gets
      out.

                             SERGEANT
                       (into radio)
                   12A75 requesting an RA unit at Grand
                   and 9th for a TC with injuries...

      SERGEANT, looking at the truly wrecked cab...

                             SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                   Are you alright? What happened?

      And the mundane beauty of the question makes Max look at him
      like he's crazy, and there are tears streaming down his face.
      The Sergeant approaches Max, gentle but firm:

                             SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                       (as if to a child)
                   You've been in an accident. An
                   ambulance is on the way to help you.
                   Do you understand what I am saying to
                   you? Sit down on the curb. Okay?
                       (Max nods)
                   Anybody else in there?

      Max shakes his head. The Sergeant shines his flashlight on the
      passenger compartment, concerned about Max.

                             SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                   Don't worry about the cab. They'll
                   get you a new one. You okay?                            *

                             MAX
                       (finds his voice)
                   I'm...fine. Fine. Just dizzy and                        *
                   shit.                                                   *

                             SERGEANT

                   You'll be okay.                                         *

      The Sergeant, now at the rear of the cab, to make sure there's
      no gasoline spill, suddenly freezes, his flashlight beam finding
      the trunk lid ajar from the crash, and inside is the corpse of
      Ramone Gallardo in a sprawled heap.

                             SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                   Put your hands where I can see 'em!
                   Get on your knees! Slowly!

      Sergeant's gun is out on Max. Max does as he's told, getting to
      his knees on the pavement. Curious. The whole thing strikes
      Max as insane. Absurd.

      behind him, covering him. Per procedure, Sergeant holsters his
      weapon, draws his cuffs, and grabs Max's right wrist, cuffing
      it.

      MAX (SLO-MO)

      One arm is brought down behind his back...

      Max grabs the gun out of the Sergeant's holster and tosses it
      under the car. He takes his second set of cuffs...

                             MAX (CONT'D)
                   Cuff yourself to the goddamn door.

      Sergeant cuffs his arm through the window frame of the open

       Stripped of everything now. Operating purely on instinct.
       Vincent's gun in his right hand, handcuff dangling from his left
       wrist...

       Running.

       The city silent around him.    The only sound is his feet hitting

       Running.

       TWO COP CARS rocketing through an intersection a block or so

       hand, braces himself, squeezes the trigger. Nothing. Is there
       a safety on this thing? He finds it.

       He tries again. FIRES TWO SHOTS into the glass door. The gun
       almost kicks out of his hand. But the door disintegrates. He
       walks through...

       ANNIE crouches under a table and crawls backwards. She can't
       hear a thing. Her heart pounds. The silence makes her want to
       scream.

       A POV of empty, scary office. Over the table, b.g., is the
       glass wall running the length of the office area. The corridor
       beyond. Empty.

       A SHADOW...? Did she see a shadow pass against the murky
       darkness out there?

       A soft sound.    Feet on carpet. Did she hear it?     Is she
       imagining it?    The breath catches in her throat.    Eyes wide.

       THE SHADOW

       in the bullpen by a corridor.      It lurks, silently.    Waiting.
       It's Vincent.

       TIGHT ON ANNIE

       Under the table...by the windows. A huddled form against the

       a statue. Then the urge is too strong.

       She's got to get out, get out now!

       around a corner, clearing space. Fast. His Para-Ordnance up.
       Max and Annie running, now... Vincent sees vague shapes...

       BOOM-BOOM! BOOM-BOOM! Gunshots punch through the glass, inches
       from Max and Annie, collapsing walls revealing Vincent against
       the LA-scape. Blossoms of white flame: BOOM-BOOM...

       by a chair, CRASHING through it, followed by Vincent, into the

       million years to do that. As they're sliding shut, he sees
       Vincent across the lobby, raising the gun...

       Max throws himself on Annie, both to the floor. BULLETS PUNCH
       through the paper-thin sheet-metal doors. But the elevator's
       moving now...

       VARIOUS ANGLES

       ...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Vincent working toward the front...
       Max and Annie desperately looking for cover. City racing by.
       Train racing by city. A few RAGGED PASSENGERS trying to huddle
       out of harm's way with nowhere to go. As the TRAIN THUNDERS AND
       SHRIEKS over the track junctures...

       THE FIRST CAR

       Max and Annie rush in, slide the door shut. This is as far as
       they can go. They drop into a crouch at the door, breathing
       hard, terrified, Max with his back against the wall, arm stiffly
       keeping the door handle wedged tight, his head just below the
       door's window. A harsh, ragged whisper:

                            ANNIE
                  Where's the next station?

       A frozen moment. Eyes locked. Knowing they're probably going
       to die together, even though they hardly know each other.

       THE TRAIN GOES BLACK, LIGHTS DYING AS THEY SHRIEK OVER ANOTHER
       JUNCTURE...then the LIGHTS RETURN, stuttering.

       Max rises slightly up, peers over the lip of the window. Here
       comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees
       Max. He shouts, barely audible from here...
                            VINCENT
                  YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX!   I DO THIS FOR A
                  LIVING!

       ...and he keeps coming, .45 at his side, a sheet of blood down
       his face from the missing part of his ear.

       ...the visage of Vincent, the .45 in his hands, scares the shit
       out of the early-morning passengers.

       ...and Max clutches the H+K, takes a deep, shaky breath, his
       eyes on Annie's, not even sure in that moment what he's going to
       do, probably die, and he lunges up, Vincent not ten feet away...

       AND THE TRAIN GOES DARK.

       A BLIZZARD OF MUZZLE FLASHES, both men FIRING THROUGH THE
       WINDOWS at each other, GLASS SHATTERING between the cars and
       getting sucked away by the wind, Max screaming, face lit only by
       the GUNFIRE, clumsy in how he holds Vincent's H+K, firing one-
       handed, not aiming, not looking where he's shooting...Vincent's
       Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME...

       ...and then abrupt silence as the LIGHTS RETURN, Max looking        *
       down, his expression nearly childlike with terror. He stares at
       the H+K in his shaking hand, sees the slide is locked back -
       gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, "go ahead, kill
       me..." through the shattered window.

       Vincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him.
       Watching Max. A little smile on his face.

107    INT. VINCENT'S CAR - NIGHT                                   107

       Vincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the
       floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the
       weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot
       Peter Yip the first time.

       Odd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His
       brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in
       fact.

       The magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among
       the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter
       quietly.

       Vincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like
       way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if
       confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back
       of the car.

       The .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor.

       Max watches Vincent walk away.

       Vincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an
       aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his
       breath.

       Max slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars.
       Slides the second door open. Enters.

       Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously
       nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the
       floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.

       Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across
       from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them.

       VINCENT + MAX

       sit there, riding the train.   Softly:

                            MAX
                  We're almost at the next station.

       Vincent smiles faintly. He leans his head toward Max as if
       conferring a secret. In a halting whisper:

                              VINCENT
                    Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies.
                        (off Max's look)
                    Think anybody'll notice?

       MAX

       looks into Vincent's eyes. It means "I'm that guy" and "will
       anybody notice me when I'm gone?"

       VINCENT

       leans back, gazing straight ahead now.   Rocking gently with the
       motion of the train...

       ...and with much effort and to Max's amazement, Vincent emits a
       soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same.

       Max has no idea what's so funny to a dying man.    Vincent looks.

       Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all
       the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:

       AN AD

       The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.   A dream place.
       Limitless horizon.                                                    *

107A   INT. VINCENT'S CAR - MAX - DAWN                                107A

       Vincent's no longer laughing.   In fact, Vincent's no longer
       doing anything. Ever.

       Annie comes to Max and sits. She shivers. Max takes off his
       zippered, hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie. It's a
       small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She
       takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the
       train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now.

       The train pulls in to a station...

       WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR

       ...and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open. They
       silently get off. The first sideways streams of yellow light
       shaft into the station.

       The doors close again.   The train pulls out.

       WE HOLD ON Vincent for a while. Riding the train by himself,
       into the dawn, his head back as if sleeping, alone in the car,     *
       as the sun rises.

       Another dead guy on the subway...riding into a new day.

       And Max, in his Polo shirt and dirty pants, an arm around Annie,   *
       wearing his stained sweatshirt, rises to us up the                 *
       escalator...freeways, arteries of traffic behind them.             *

                                              FADE OUT
